JAKE AND ELWOOD IN THE CAR
                        JAKE
            What's this?
FADE IN:

What?
ELWOOD
                        JAKE
            This car. This stupid car. Where's the
            Cadillac? The Caddy? Where's the Caddy?
                        ELWOOD
The what?
                        JAKE
            The Cadillac we used to have. The Blues
Mobile!
                        ELWOOD
            I traded it.
                        JAKE
            You traded the Blues Mobile for this?
                        ELWOOD
            No. For a microphone.
                        JAKE
            A microphone? Okay I can see that. Well,
            what the hell is this?
                        ELWOOD
            This was a bargain. I picked it up at the
            Mount Prospect City Police auction last
            spring. It's an old Mount Prospect Police
            Car. They were practically giving them
            away.
                        JAKE
            Well, thank you pal, the day I get out of
            prison, my own brother picks me up in a
            police car.
Fog horn and warning bell sounds.
                        ELWOOD
            You don't like it?
                        JAKE
            No, I don't like it.
Elwood drives over a raising draw bridge.
                        JAKE
            Cars got a lot of pick up.

                        ELWOOD
            It's got a cop motor, a four hundred and
            forty cubic inch plant, it's got cop tires,
            cop suspension, cop shocks, it was a model
            made before catalytic converters so it'll
            run good on regular gas. Whaddya say? Is it
            the new Blues Mobile or what?
                        JAKE
            Fix the cigarette lighter.
OUTSIDE THE ORPHANAGE
                        JAKE
            What are we doing here?
                        ELWOOD
            You promised you'd visit the penguin the
            day you got out.
                        JAKE
            Yeah? So, I lied to her.
                        ELWOOD
            You can't lie to a nun. We gotta go in and
            visit the penguin.
                        JAKE
            No fucking way!
INSIDE THE ORPHANAGE
Jake and Elwood go in and climb the stairs until they reach a door. Just before Elwood knocks on the door, a voice is heard from inside.
NUN Who is it?
                        ELWOOD
            Jake and Elwood.
NUN
            Come in.
They go in. The door shuts behind them.
                        NUN
            Hello boys, nice to see you. Please, have a
            seat.
Jack and Elwood sit on seats at back of room.
                        NUN
            No no boys. Come over here in front of me.
            I want to see your faces.

They shuffle up a bit closer.
                        NUN
            The county took a tax assessment of this
            property last month. They want five
            thousand dollars.
                        ELWOOD
            Doesn't the church have to pay that?
                        NUN
            They would if they were interested in
            keeping the place, but they aren't. The
            Arch Bishop wants to sell this building
            outright to the board of Education.
                        ELWOOD
            What's gonna happen to you?
                        NUN
            I'll be sent to the missions.
                        JAKE
            Forget it, five grand; no problem, we'll
            have it for you in the morning. Let's go
            Elwood.
                        NUN
            NO NO! I will not take your filthy stolen
money.
                        JAKE
            Well then, I guess you're really up shit
            creek.
The nun hits Jake on the hand with a ruler.
                        NUN
            I beg your pardon what did you say?
                        JAKE
            I offered to help you. You refused to take
            our money, then I said "I guess you're
            really up shit creek"
She hit's him again.
                        ELWOOD
            Christ Jake take it easy, man
NUN
Elwood!
She starts hitting them both as the language deteriorates.
                        ELWOOD
            Ah you fat penguin!

The ruler breaks and the Nun reaches for a sword. Jake and Elwood go tumbling down the stairs.
                        NUN
            You are such a disappointing pair. I prayed
            so hard for you. It saddens and hurts me
            that the two young men whom I raised to
            believe in the ten commandments have
            returned to me as two thieves, with filthy
            mouths and bad attitudes. Get out! And
            don't come back until you've redeemed
            yourselves.
She disappears back into her office and the door mysteriously closes.
                        CURTIS
            Boys, you gotta learn not to talk to nuns
            that way. Jake! Elwood!
                        JAKE & ELWOOD
Curtis!
                        CURTIS
            Hey, buy you boys a drink?
CURTIS'S KITCHEN
                        CURTIS
            Boys, things are bad. They're gonna sell
            this place to the board of education and
            I'll be out on the street. That money's
            gotta be in the Cook County Assessors
            office within 11 days.
                        JAKE
            They wouldn't turn you out would they?
                        CURTIS
            Shit. What's one more old nigger to the
            board of education?
                        ELWOOD
            Curtis, you and the penguin are the the
            only family we got. And you're the only one
            that was ever good to us. Singing Elmore
            James tunes and blowing the harp for us
            down here.
                        CURTIS
            Well, the sister was right. You boys could
            use a little churching up. Slide on down to
            the Triple Rock and catch Reverend
            Cleophis. You boys listen to what he's got
            to say.

                        JAKE
            Curtis, I don't wanna listen to no jive ass
            preacher talking to me about heaven and
            hell.
                        CURTIS
            Jake, you get wise! You get to church!
AT THE TRIPLE ROCK CHURCH
                        MC
            And now, this weeks sermon is from our
            beloved the Reverend Cleophis James.
                        REVEREND JAMES
            And now people. And now people. When I woke
            up this morning, I heard a disturbing
            sound. I said, when I woke up this morning
            I heard a disturbing sound. What I heard
            was the jingle-jangle of a thousand lost
            souls. And I'm talking about the souls of
            all the men and women, departed from this
            life. Wait a minute, the Lord says the
            souls of us here on earth is, secret of
            divine life, they'll not find. Because it's
            too late... Too late yeah, too late for
            them to ever see again, the light they once
            chose not to follow, don't be lost when the
            time comes. For the day of the Lord cometh,
            out of deep in the night. Amen. Amen.
SONG: "The Old Landmark" (congregation singing and dancing).
                        ELWOOD
            Jake, you alright?
Ray of sunlight shines through the church onto Jake.
                        JAKE
            The band...
                     (louder)

                     (louder)

                        REVEREND JAMES

ELWOOD

                        REVEREND JAMES
            Have you seen the light?
                        JAKE
            Yes, Yes! Jesus H. god damned bastard
            Christ, I have seen the light!
Jake starts dancing with the others.

            The band Elwood. The band!
                        ELWOOD

                        REVEREND JAMES
Praise God.
                        ELWOOD
            And God bless the United States of America.
JAKE AND ELWOOD, IN THEIR CAR
SONG: "Soothe me" (In the background.)
                        JAKE
            We'll put the band back together, do a few
            gigs, we get some bread. Bang! Five
            thousand bucks.
                        ELWOOD
            Yeah, well, getting the band back together
            might not be that easy.
                        JAKE
            What're you talking about?
                        ELWOOD
            They split, they all took straight jobs.
                        JAKE
            Yeah so you know where they are. You said
            you were gonna keep in touch with them
                        ELWOOD
            I got a coupla leads, a few phone numbers,
            but I mean, how many of them visited or
            even wrote you huh?
                        JAKE
            They're not the kinda guys who write
            letters. You were outside, I was inside,
            you were s'posed to keep in touch with the
            band. I kept asking you if we were gonna
            play again.

                        ELWOOD
            Well, what was I gonna do? Take away you're
            only hope? Take away the very thing that
            kept you going in there? I took the liberty
            of bullshitting you, okay?
                        JAKE
            You lied to me.
                        ELWOOD
            It wasn't lies, it was just bullshit.
Jake and Elwood are in the car, and go through a yellow traffic light. Police lights flash in the rear view mirror.
Shit!
What?
Rollers.
No?
Yeah.
ELWOOD
JAKE
ELWOOD
JAKE
ELWOOD
JAKE
Shit.
Elwood pulls over as directed and an officer approaches the car.
                        ELWOOD
            What? What did I do?
                        OFFICER DANIEL
            You failed to stop at a red signal.
                        ELWOOD
            The light was yellow sir.
                        OFFICER DANIEL
            May I see your license please?
He takes the license back to the squad car.
                        JAKE
Goddamnit!
                        ELWOOD
            Man I haven't been pulled over in six
            months. I bet those cops have got SCMODS.
                        JAKE
SCMODS?

ELWOOD
State, County, Municipal, Offender, Data,
System.
The two officers return to Jake and Elwood's car.
                        OFFICER DANIEL
            Elwood, we show your license currently
            under suspension. Step out of the car
            please.
Elwood starts the car and drives off. The officers run back to their car and follow.
                        JAKE
            First you trade the Caddilac for a
            microphone, then you lie to me about the
            band, now you're gonna put me right back in
            the joint.
                        ELWOOD
            They're not gonna catch us. We're on a
            mission from God.
                        JAKE

Elwood turns into a parking lot. Officers pursue.
                        ELWOOD
            It would be alright if we could just get
            back on the expressway.
                        JAKE

                        JAKE
            What the hell do you want me to do
motorhead?
                        ELWOOD
            Well, try not to be so negative all the
            time. Why don't you offer some constructive
            criticism?
                        JAKE
            You got us into this parking lot pal, so

OUTSIDE ELWOODS PLACE
                        ELWOOD
            Nice place, huh?
Mystery Women blows up the front doors with a rocket launcher. Jake and Elwood recover and go inside.
                        ELWOOD
            Hey Sam... Hey Lloyd, anybody call for me
on the phone?
                        LLOYD
            No, no calls. Some guy left this card. Cop.
            Said he'd be back.

                        JAKE
            How often does the train go by?
                        ELWOOD
            So often you won't even notice it.
                        JAKE

            address.
                        ELWOOD
            No, they don't got my address. I falsified
            my renewal. Put down 1060 West Addison.
                        JAKE
            1060 West Addison? That's Wrigley Field.
                        ELWOOD
            I gotta hit the sack.

Notices Jake asleep in his bed.

                        MERCER
            You know, I kinda liked the Wrigley Field
bit.
                        OFFICER MOUNT
            Yeah, real cute.
They enter the building and go to Elwoods door.
                        MERCER
Stand back.
As Mr. Mercer kicks the door in, the Mystery Woman flicks the switch on her remote control, and the whole building blows up. Jake and Elwood get up and brush themselves off.
                        ELWOOD
            It's almost nine o'clock. We gotta go to

MRS. TORANTINO

                        ELWOOD
            Did they live quietly? What were there
            personal habits?
                        MRS. TORANTINO
            They were good boys, but they made a lot of
            racket at night. Are you the police?
                        ELWOOD
            No ma'am. We're musicians.
They return to the car and prepare to leave. Mrs Torantino chases them.

They all meet Jake and Elwood at one of the tables.

            rehabilitated, what's next what's
            happening, whatcha gonna do? You got the
            money you owe us motherfucker?
            JAKE
Did they leave a forwarding address? A
phone number?
            MRS. TORANTINO

            ELWOOD
Look let's just get something straight
here. The reason he got locked in the
slammer in the first place was for sticking
up a gas station to cover you guys.
            DONALD
You're kidding!
            ELWOOD
He pulled that job to pay for the bands
room service tab from that Chiwanous gig in
Pols city.
STEVE
He did?
            JAKE
That's right, so I don't wanna hear anymore
of this small change shit.
            ELWOOD
We're putting the band back together.
            JAKE
You were the backbone. The nerve centre of
a great rhythm and blues band. You can,
make that live, breath and jump again.
Murph and the Magic tones? Look at you in
those candy ass monkey suits. And I thought
I had it bad in Joliet.
            WILLIE
At least we got a change in clothes sucker,
you're wearing the same shit you had on
three years ago.
            DONALD
Jake ain't lying though. We had a band
powerful enough to turn goat piss into
gasoline.
            TOM
But we'll never get that fab sound again,
not without some more horns. We'll never
get Mr. Fabulous.
            JAKE
Where is he?
            MURPH
Forget it. Mr Fabulous is the top Matre 'd
at the Chez Paul. He's pulling down six
bills a week.
            STEVE
Yeah and Matt Murphy up and got himself
married.

                        ELWOOD
            Where is Matt guitar Murphy?
                        TOM
            He opened a soul food restaurant with his
            old lady on Maxwell Street, and he took
            Blue Lou with him.
                        WILLIE
            You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous outta
            them high paying gigs.
                        JAKE
            Oh yeah? Well me and the Lord. We got an
            understanding.

            I'm sure we'll have a table for you in just
            a few minutes.
Jake and Elwood are ignored until Jake whistles very loudly.
                        MR. FABULOUS

                        ARETHA
            They look like they're from the CIA or
something.
                        MATT
            What they want to eat?
                        ARETHA
            The tall one wants white bread, toast, dry
            with nothing on it.
                        MATT
Elwood!
                        ARETHA
            And the other one wants four whole fried
            chickens and a Coke.
                        MATT
            And Jake! Shit, the Blues Brothers!
Matt goes out into the cafe.

Hi Jake.
MATT
            JAKE
Matt. How you doing?
            MATT
Hi Elwood. How ya doing? How was Joliet.
            JAKE
Oh it was bad. Thursday night they'd serve
a wicked pepper steak.
            MATT
Can't be as bad as the cabbage role at the
Terra-Phelevo Penn.
            ELWOOD
Or that oatmeal at the Cook County slammer.
            MATT
Well they're all pretty bad.
            JAKE
Matt, me and Elwood, we're putting the band
back together. We need you and Blue Lou.
            MATT
Oh man. Don't talk that way round here. My
old lady, she'll kill me.
            ELWOOD
Ma'am you gotta understand that this is a
lot bigger than any domestic problems you
might be experiencing.
            ARETHA
Matt, what the hell is he talking about?
            MATT
Don't get roused sugar.
            ARETHA
Don't you "Don't get roused sugar" me! Now
you not going back on the road no more, and
you ain't playing no more two bit sleazy
dives. You're living with me now, and
you're not gonna go sliding around with you
old white hoodlum friends.
            MATT
But babe, this is Jake and Elwood. The
Blues Brothers.
            ARETHA
The Blues Brothers! Shit, they still owe
you money, fool!

                        JAKE
            Ma'am, would it make you feel any better if
            you knew that what we asking Matt here to
            do was a holy thing?
                        ELWOOD
            You see, we're on a mission from God.
                        ARETHA
            Don't you blaspheme in here! Don't you
            blaspheme in here! Now this is my man and
            my restaurant and you two are gonna just
            walk right out that door, without ya dry
            white toast, without ya four fried chickens
            and without Matt guitar Murphy.
                        MATT
            Now listen to me. I love you, but I'm the
            man and your the woman. And I'll make the
            decisions concerning my life.
                        ARETHA
            You better think about what you're saying.
            You better think about the consequences of
            your actions.
                        MATT
            Oh shut up woman!
SONG: "Think", sung by Aretha with customers backing and dancing Matt undoes his apron and drops it on the floor as he leaves.
                        MATT
            Let's boogie.
Blue Lou looks at them leaving.
                        ARETHA
                     (to Blue Lou)
            Well, go ahead dammit.
ARETHA
Shit!
CURL UP AND DYE BEAUTY SALON
"Mystery Woman" is reading the instruction booklet for the flame thrower she uses later in the movie.
RAY'S MUSIC EXCHANGE
The band looks around the shop. Elwood finds an electric toaster and pulls a slice of white bread out of his jacket.
He leaves.

                        RAY
            Pardon me, but we do have a strict policy
concerning the handling of the instruments. An employee of Ray's Music Exchange must be present. Now, may I help you?
                        JAKE
            Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake. I once rented
            some column speakers from you for my band,
            The Blues Brothers.
                        MURPH
            Hey Ray it's me Murph of Murph and the
            Magic tones. Remember me? I bought three
            Fender amps.
                        RAY
            Oh we sell a lot of amplifiers.
                        MURPH
            Not like these they were beautiful.
            Upholstered with thick red shag.
                        RAY
            Oh right, right. I remember now. As a
            matter of fact I buy 'em all back for $350
            a piece.
                        MURPH
            350? I paid $800 each not six months ago.
                        RAY
            Oh well you know depreciation man.
                        JAKE
            Ray we're here to buy stuff. We need
            pianos, amps, mikes the works.
A boy attempts to steal a guitar in the background - Ray pulls out a pistol and fires into the wall above the boys head.
                        RAY
            Now go on! Git! It breaks my heart, a boy
            that young goin' bad.
Murph notices an electric piano.
                        MURPH
            Tell me a little about this electric piano,
Ray.
                        RAY
            Ah you have a good eye my man. That's the
            best in the city of Chicago.
                        JAKE
How much?

                        RAY
            Two thousand bucks and it's yours. You can
            take it home with you. As a matter of fact
            I'll through the black keys in for free.
                        JAKE
            Two thousand for this chunk o'shit? Come on
Ray.
                        MURPH
            I mean really Ray, it's used, there's no
action left in this keyboard.
Ray comes out from behind the counter and sits at the piano.
                        RAY
            Excuse me, I don't think there's anything
wrong with the action on this piano.
SONG: "Tailfeather", Ray Charles, Blues Brothers dancing.
                        JAKE
            OK man, we'll take these axes.
                        RAY
            Naturally, and as usual, I gotta take an I-
            owe-you. But I Like Smoking Propane
THEY PULL INTO A ROADSIDE RESTURAUNT
Everyone gets out of the cars
                        JAKE
            You guys go on inside get yourselves a
            bite. I've gotta make a phone call.
                        MR. FABULOUS
            Now Jake, does this phone call concern our
first gig?
                        JAKE
            Have I ever lied to you?
Jake and Elwood walk away, towards a pay phone.
                        ELWOOD
            What are we gonna do man? We got no gig.
                        JAKE
            How much money you got?
                        ELWOOD
            I got a quarter.
                        JAKE
            It's enough for a phone call, come on.

Jake and Elwood enter the phone booth, together.
                        JAKE
            What are you doing Elwood?
                        ELWOOD
            You said we were gonna make a call.
                        JAKE
            I said I was gonna make a call.
                        ELWOOD
            Who you gonna call Jake?
                        JAKE
            Remember Maurie Sline?
                        ELWOOD
            Sline? The booking agent? What about him?
                        JAKE
            Well, he got us some good showcases in the
            old days. He got us the Morgan Park, he got
            us the Tic Tock, I got him laid, he owes
            me.
                        ELWOOD
            Give it a shot.
"Mystery Woman" drives up and attacks phone booth with flame thrower. There's a gas tank next to the booth labeled "No Smoking Propane". The explosion launches the phone booth into the air, with Jake and Elwood in it, and then smashes to the ground. Car drives off. Coins are scattered all over the ground from the phone.
                        ELWOOD
            Hey Jake, there's gotta be at least seven
            dollars worth of change here.
NAZI HEAD QUARTERS
Head Nazi is at desk. 2nd Nazi knocks on door.
Yeah?
Sir.
NAZI LEADER
2ND NAZI
            NAZI LEADER
What'd you find out?
            2ND NAZI
Okay. I called a friend at the Motor
Vehicle department. That licence plate is
like a rash all over the computer. The car
belongs to a known traffic menace.

                        NAZI LEADER
            What's his name?
                        2ND NAZI
            His name is Elwood Blues. He's got a record
            a mile long. And, he's a catholic.
                        NAZI LEADER
            Did you get his address?
                        2ND NAZI
            Of course. 1060 West Addison.
NAZI LEADER
Let's go.
They drive out to the address, 1060 West Addison. It turns out to be Wrigley Field, home of the Cubs Baseball Team.
                        NAZI LEADER
                     (to group)
            Anybody with that kind of record is gonna
            make a mistake. I want all party members in
            the tri state district to monitor the city,
            county and state police on there CB. Mr.
            Blues is gonna fuck up. And when he does,
            he'd better pray the police get to him
            before we do.
BOB'S COUNTRY BUNKER
The band is driving along a dark, quiet road.
                        MR. FABULOUS
            Alright man, we've been in this car for
            three hours now. Where the hell is this
            place?
                        JAKE
            I told you it would take a little while to
get there.
                        MURPH
            What's the name of the place?
                        JAKE
            Ah... the name of the place...
Jake sees a neon sign ahead with the name of a bar on it.
                        JAKE
            Is ah... Bob's Country Bunker. Here we are.
                        ELWOOD
            Bob's Country Bunker?
They arrive.

                        MR. FABULOUS
            Jake, the sign says "Tonight Only The Good
Ole' Boys".
                        JAKE
            Blues Brothers. It should read "Tonight
only the Blues Brothers triumphant return". Must be some kind of mistake. You guys unload the stuff. Elwood, come with me.
Jake and Elwood head for the bar.
                        CLAIRE
            Well now what can I get you boys? Are ya
            thirsty, ya hungry, or you just driving
            through? Maybe you'd like a beer or
            something a little harder? Hey, you know we
            happen to make the states best pepper
            steak.
                        JAKE
            No thank you ma'am. We may be sucking back
            a few beers a little later on. We'll be
            here all night. You see, we're the band.
                        CLAIRE
            You are? Oh, gee, that's nice.
                     (to Bob)
            Hey Bob!! This is the band!
BOB
Alright!
                        ELWOOD
            Er... what kind of music do you usually
have here?
                        CLAIRE
            Oh, we got both kinds. We got Country, and
Western.
                        ELWOOD
            Jake, are you sure this is the place?
                        JAKE
            Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. This is the place.
Bob walks up to them.
                        BOB
            Hi. You the Good Ole' Boys?
                        JAKE
            That's us. The rest of the bands out in the
            parking lot getting our stuff together.

                        BOB
            Well I'm sure glad to have you boys here.
            I'm Bob and this here is my place.
                        JAKE
            Well its a beautiful place Bob.
The rest of the band walks in with the gear.
                        BOB
            I guess you boys wanna get your steel
            guitars and everything set up on the stage
            don't ya. Claire get over there and turn
            those stage lights on and get these boys
            going up there.
The lights go on and Lou notices the stage is screened off with chicken wire.
                        LOU
            Chicken wire?
Later on, a good size crowd has gathered and rednecks are talking and drinking. Elwood has a song list with requests on it.
                        ELWOOD
            Man, I don't think we know any of the songs
on this list.
                        JAKE
            Oh this list doesn't mean anything, they're
            just requests. We're a regular set.
                        MURPH
            Gimme some lovin. 1, 2...
                        JAKE
            1, 2, 3, 4.
                        ELWOOD
            Good evening ladies and gentlemen we're
            sure glad to be here in Cocomo tonight.
            We're the Good Ole' Blues Brothers, boys,
            band from Chicago. I sure hope you like our
            show. I'm Elwood, this here's my brother
            Jake.
SONG: "Gimme some Lovin"
The crowd start yelling at the band and hurling bottles at the stage like crazy. There's a shower of glass smashing against the chicken wire.
IN A BACK ROOM
                        BOB
            That ain't no Hank Williams song.

He comes out and switches the stage lights off.
                        MURPH
            I think you hit the lights!
                        WILLIE
            Maybe they blew a fuse?
                        LOU
            I don't think so man. Those lights are off
on purpose.
                        ELWOOD
            Okay. We gotta figure out something these
            people like and fast.
                        MURPH
            Hey I got it. Remember the theme from
Rawhide?
                        ELWOOD
            The old favourite. Rowdy Yates.
MURPH
What key?
                        DONALD
            A. Blues country key.
                        ELWOOD
            Rawhide in A.
SONG: "Theme from Rawhide"
The crowd is passified, the lights come back on. They finish the song.
                        ELWOOD
            Theme from the TV show Rawhide. Thankyou.
                        JAKE
            Now we'd like to do a favourite of the horn
            section. We hope it's one of yours.
SONG: "Stand by your man"
                        JAKE
            Well folks it's time to call it a night. Do
            what you feel and keep both feet on the
            wheel. You don't have to go home but you
            can't stay here. So till next time...
SONG: "Theme from Rawhide"
                        JAKE
                     (to the band)
            Let's get the hell outta here.

They start packing up, Bob approaches Jake and Elwood.
                        BOB
            Shit I'm gonna tell you boys that's some of
            the best goddamn music we've had in the
            Country Bunker in a long time.
                        ELWOOD
            Well uh... sorry we couldn't remember the
            Wreck of the Old 97.
                        BOB

            That's right. Uh $200, and you boys drank
            $300 worth of beer.
                        ELWOOD
            Uh, well, like, when we first come in the
            bar lady never charged us for the first
            round so like we figured you know beer was
            like complimentary for the band, you know.
                        BOB
            Uh, hu hu, Uh-Uh.
Bob shakes his head.
                        JAKE
            Well, I'll just go and take up a collection
            from the boys.
                        BOB
            Well, I tell ya, I sure would appreciate
it.
Jake and Elwood head out to the cars. The band are talking about the gig.
                        WILLIE
            I say this trip is no where man. I say we

                        MURPH
            What? Quit? Well I wish you guys would make
            up your mind. Otherwise I've gotta call Mr.

                        JAKE
                     (approaches the band)

The band leaves.
                        ELWOOD
            The boys look a little upset. Hey man,
            don't worry, we got a coupla days. We'll
            get the penguins tax money. I mean look, we
            got an appointment to see Mr. Sline
            tomorrow. Everything's gonna be alright.
            Let's skate.
An RV pulls into the parking lot.
                        JAKE
Goddammit.
Jake and Elwood walk towards the RV as the Good Ole Boys are getting out.
                        JAKE

Jake holds up a crunched cigarette packet very quickly as though it were an ID bage of some kind.
                        JAKE
            My name is Jacob Stein, the American
            Federation of Musicians Union local 200.

            stop us? Stein? You're gonna look pretty
            funny trying to eat corn on the cob with no

                        ELWOOD
            We'll uh... we'll talk to Bob.
Jake and Elwood slowly retreat as Bob comes out to the parking lot.
                        JAKE
            Get in the car and start her up.
Elwood goes to the car, Jake goes over to Bob.
                        BOB
            You know you boys owe me a lot over money
            for that beer you drank tonight goddammit.
                        JAKE
            Bob, we loved playing here tonight. My
            brother's writing out an American Express
            travellers cheque to cover the extensive
            bar tab.
                        BOB
            Well, I sure would appreciate it.
                        JAKE
            I'd better check up, see how he's doing,
            see I have to sign it too. I usually sit in
            the car and write it out on the glove
            compartment lid. Okay?
Jake walks towards the car and feels his jacket pockets.
                        JAKE
            Need a Pencil!
Jake gets in the car, Elwood starts it and they drive off. The Good Ole boys rush over to Bob.
                        LEADER
            Were them guys from the union?

                        BOB

                        MURPH
            What can they be doing?

Jake and Elwood park the car in a storm drain tunnel near the ballroom.
                        JAKE
            Oh. My head hurts. That nitrates a mean

Throughout the song, Jake and Elwood sneak up to the hotel. They come across the Winnebago. Elwood enters and glues down the accelerator.
                        ELWOOD

                        CURTIS
            And now ladies and gentlemen, it is the
            distinct pleasure of the management to
            present to you, the evening's star
            attraction. Here they are back after their
            exclusive three year tour of Europe,
            Scandinavia and the sub continent. Won't
            you welcome from Calumet City Illinios, the
            show band of Joliet Jake and Elwood
            Blues... The Blues Brothers.
Jake and Elwood enter the stage during the brass section of the intro music, and and Jake does a
cartwheel and lands besides Elwood right on cue with the last beat of the song... the audience is deathly quiet.
                        JAKE
            1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

                        JAKE
            It looks like the Mafia is out there.
                        AGENT

            Something's wrong.
                        MR. MERCER
            Where's Jake?
                        TUCKER
                     (to Good Ole Boys)
            Where'd those Blues Brothers go?
IN THE SEWER
                        ELWOOD
            I sure hope this thing leads some place.
                        JAKE
            Elwood. We're gone man.

The "Mystery Woman" loosens off a round of machine gun fire. They hit the ground.
                        ELWOOD
            Who is that girl?
                        WOMAN
            Well Jake. You like just fine down there,
            slithering in the mud like vermin.
                        JAKE
                     (to Elwood)
No problem.
                        WOMAN
            You're not gonna get away from me this
            time.
She fires again... still missing them.
IN THE BALLROOM
Mr. Mercer hears the gunshots.
                        MR. MERCER
                     (to officers)
            Check that out. Let's go. Come on.
BACK IN THE SEWER
                        JAKE
                     (to Woman)
            It's good to see you sweetheart.
                        WOMAN
            You contemptible pig. I remained celebate
            for you. I stood at the back of a
            cathedral, waiting in celibacy for you,
            with 300 friends and relatives in
            attendance. My uncle hired the best
            Romanian caterer in the state. To obtain
            the seven limousines for the wedding party
            my father used up his last favours with Mad
            Pete Trollo. So for me, for my mother, my
            grandmother, my father, my uncle and for
            the common good, I must now kill you and
            your brother.
Jake gets up and slowly walks towards her.
                        JAKE
                     (falling to his knees
                     before her)
            Oh please don't kill us. Please, please
            don't kill us. You know I love ya baby, I
            wouldn't leave ya. It wasn't my fault.

                        WOMEN
            You miserable slug. You think you can talk
            you're way out of this? You betrayed me.
                        JAKE
            No, I didn't. Honest. I ran outta gas. I
            had a flat tire. I didn't have enough money
            for cab fare. My tux didn't come back from
            the cleaners. An old friend came in from
            outta town. Someone stole my car. There was
            an earthquake, a terrible flood, locust's.
            It wasn't my fault!! I swear to God!!
                        WOMAN
            Oh Jake, Jake, honey.
Jake embraces her in a passionate kiss, then drops her in the mud.
Let's go.
  JAKE
(to Elwood)
  ELWOOD
(to the Woman)
Take it easy.
They run down the passage to the car. She follows in the distance.
                        ELWOOD
            It's a 106 miles to Chicago. We got a full
            tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes,
            it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.
JAKE
Hit it!
The Woman runs out of the duct and fires at the moving car. The policemen above hear the shots and also start shooting at the car.
THE GREAT CAR CHASE
Jake and Elwood are in front in their car. About 50 or so squad cars and the Good Ole Boys Winnebago is following.
IN THE WINNEBAGO
                        BOB
            Shit man! Can't this damm thing go any
            faster than this?
                        TUCKER
            Ah, Bob, I think I got a little problem.
                        BOB
            Goddamn boy!

They accelerate past all cars including Jake and Elwoods. TUCKER
Shit!
ALL
Argh!!!
The van drives off the highway, through a shed and into
                        TUCKER
                     (to Bob)

JAKE AND ELWOOD MAKE IT TO CHICAGO
                        ELWOOD
            Well this is definitely Lower Wacker drive.
            If my estimations are correct, we should be
            very close to the honourable Richard J.
            Daly plaza.
                        JAKE
            That's were they got that Picasso.
ELWOOD
Yep.
They drive on, being chased by Chicago squad cars. Elwood swerves to miss a car, the squad cars don't and all crash into one another.
                        OFFICER
            Son-of-a-bitch.

A loud clunk is heard in Jake and Elwood's car.
ELWOOD
Oh no!
                        JAKE
            What the fuck was that?
                        ELWOOD
            The motor. Thrown a rod.
                        JAKE
            Is that serious?
ELWOOD
Yep.
They drive up a bridge through the smoke coming from their motor. One of the Nazi cars stop at the head of the bridge.
NAZI LEADER
Faster!
At the last minute they see the end of an unfinished bridge. Elwood stops the car and then it backflips over the chasing Nazi car.
NAZI
Holy shit!
The Nazi car continues to accelerate and launches off the bridge.
                        NAZI
            I've always loved you.
They crash into the street making a big hole. Jake and Elwood's car jumps the hole, the pursuing Nazi car falls into it.

Come on!
RICHARD J. DALEY PLAZA
They enter the building, close the doors and pile furniture in front of them. They then run up to an information counter.

                        ELWOOD
                     (to an officer at the
                     information desk)
            Sir. Where's the Office of the Assessor of
            Cook County?
                        OFFICER
            Down the hall, turn right, take the
            elevator to 1102.
                        ELWOOD
            Thank you sir.
Jake and Elwood race off. Outside thousands of people are trying to get in. Jake and Elwood enter the elevator. A squad of people eventually get into the building and race up to the information desk.
                        SQUAD LEADER
            Excuse me, did you see two guys come in
            here, black suits black hats one carrying a
            briefcase?
                        OFFICER

SQUAD LEADER
Thank you.
The squad races towards the elevator and then up the stairs. Jake and Elwood make it to the right floor.
                        ELWOOD
            Hold the door.
Jake steps in front of the door. Elwood destroys the elevators controls.
ELWOOD
Let's go.
They make their way towards the officer. Stacking furniture in front of each door. They arrive at the office to a sign "Back in five minutes". They wait until someone in the office approaches them.
                        ASSESSOR
            May I help you?
                        JAKE

Right.
ASSESSOR

                        ELWOOD

The squad approaches the right floor but the door is blocked.
                        OFFICER
            Stand back... fire!
They open fire on the door.
                        ASSESSOR

The squad catches up with Jake and Elwood and cuff them.
