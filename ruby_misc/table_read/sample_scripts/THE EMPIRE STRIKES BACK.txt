1 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY     1

  A white snowscape races toward camera ... the MAIN
  TITLE quickly recedes, followed by a roll-up.

    Episode V:

    THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK ...
    After the destruction of its
    most feared battle station, the
    Empire has declared martial law
    throughout the galaxy.

    A million worlds have felt the
    oppressive hand of the Emperor
    as He attempts to crush the
    growing rebellion.

    As the Imperial grip of tyranny
    tightens, Princess Leia and the
    small band of freedom fighters
    search for a more secure base of
    operations ...

  The roll-up disappears into the black horizon.

2 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY     2

  The camera tilts down bringing into view a small
  figure galloping across the windswept ice slope.

3 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY           3

  A closer panning shot reveals a bundled rider on a
  large gray snow lizard, called a TAUNTAUN.  Curving
  plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws
  of the two-legged beast.

4 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - SLOPE - DAY         4

  The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to
  a stop.

5 EXT PLAINS OF HOTH - SLOPE - DAY        5

  He pulls off his protective goggles.  It is LUKE
  SKYWALKER.  He notices something in the sky and takes
  a pair of electro-binoculars from his utility belt.

6 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - LUKE'S POV - DAY        6

  From LUKE'S POV, we follow a bright object as it falls
  to the ground.  On the distant horizon, an explosion
  marks the point of impact.

7 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - SLOPE - DAY         7

  The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap as he activates
  a com-link transmitter.  His lizard is nervous.

          LUKE
      (to the Tauntaun)
    Easy girl, it's just another
    meteorite.
      (into com-link)
    Han ... Han ol' buddy, do you
    read me?

  After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

          LUKE
    I've finished my circle and I
    haven't picked up any life read-
    ings.

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    There isn't enough life on this
    ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
    My sentry markers are placed.
    I'm heading back to the base.

          LUKE
    I'll see you shortly.
    A meteorite just hit the ground
    near here and I want to check it
    out .. Won't be long.

8 EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - SLOPE - DAY         8

  Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his
  lizard, which seems frightened.  Luke pats the beast
  on the head to calm it.

          LUKE
    Weeho, girl!  What's the matter
    ... you smell something?  There's
    nothing out there.  I'll check
    again ...

  Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to
  adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him
  from behind, followed by a monstrous HOWL.  Luke turns and
  looks up at an eleven foot high shape towering over him.

          LUKE
    Son of a jumping ...!!!

  He grabs for his pistol, but is HIT flat in the face
  by a huge, white claw, knocking him into the snow,
  bloody and unconscious.

9 CLOSE-UP LUKE             9

  Luke falls unconscious into the snow.  The terrified
  screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible
  snap of a neck being broken.

10  EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - SLOPE - DAY       10

  The WAMPA ICE MONSTER grabs Luke by one ankle and
  drags him away.

11  EXT METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY   11

  A WEIRD MECHANICAL SOUND is heard over the whining of
  the wind.  A strange PROBE ROBOT, with several extended
  sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater.  The
  ominous robot FLOATS across the snow plain, and disap-
  pears into the distance.

12  EXT ICE CAVES - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY   12

  A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance
  of an enormous ice cave.

13  INT MAIN HANGAR DECK - REBEL BASE       13

  Rebel troopers are rushing about unloading supplies
  and otherwise securing their new base.  The rider
  swings rakishly off his lizard and pulls away his
  goggles: HAN SOLO.  He walks briskly into the main
  hangar deck toward the MILLENNIUM FALCON, which is parked
  among several fighters.  Mechanics, R-2 units and various
  other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium
  Falcon.  His Wookiee co-pilot is welding on the back of
  a central lifter.  Now he stops work and lifts his face
  shield; CHEWIE growls a greeting to his boss.

          HAN
    Cold isn't the word for it, Chewie.
    I'll take a good fight any day
    over all this hidin' and freezin'!
    ... How you coming with those
    lifters?

  The Wookiee GRUMBLES a reply.

          HAN
    All right.  I'll go  report then
    I'll give you a hand with them.
    Soon as those lifters are fixed,
    we're out of here.

  Chewbacca lets out with a joyful CHUCKLE and returns
  to his work as Han leaves.

14  INT COMMAND CENTER - ICE CAVE       14

  A makeshift   command center has been set up in a blaster
  area of thick ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive
  of activity.  Controllers, troopers, and droids move
  about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring
  radar signals.  GENERAL RIEEKAN straightens up from a
  console as Han approaches.

          RIEEKAN
    Captain Solo.  What's the situation?

          HAN
    There isn't a hint of life in
    the area.  But all the perimeter
    markers are set, so you'll know
    if anyone comes calling.

          RIEEKAN
    Good, and Commander Skywalker?

          HAN
    He's checking out a meteorite
    that hit near him. He'll be in
    soon.

          RIEEKAN
      (indicates radar screen)
    With all the meteor activity in
    this system, it's going to be
    difficult to spot approaching
    ships.

          HAN
    The Empire won't look for you out
    here.  I'd say you're all set ...
    which means it's time for me to
    get going.

          LEIA (OS)
    You're leaving?

  The two men turn to see PRINCESS LEIA, dressed in a
  short white combat jacket and pants.  She is upset by
  Han's news.  Her hair is braided and tied across her
  head in a Ò30'sÓ Nordic fashion ...

          HAN
    That's right.

          RIEEKAN
    You're an extraordinary fighter.
    I hate to lose you.

          HAN
    Thank you, General.  But there's
    a price on my head.  If I don't
    pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a
    walking dead man.

          RIEEKAN
    I understand.  A death mark is
    not an easy thing to live with ...
    Until our paths cross again,
    may the force be with you.

  Rieekan touches Han and moves away.  Han turns to
  Leia.

          HAN
      (with feeling)
    I guess this is it, Your Highness.

  Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer
  him.  He shakes his head and adopts a cooler tone.

          HAN
    Well, don't get all mushy on me.
    So long, Princess.

  Han walks away.  Leia stews a moment, then follows him.

15  INT ICE CORRIDOR - REBEL BASE - HOTH      15

  Han strides down a corridor carved from the ice.  Leia
  follows quickly, agitated.  Behind them, unnoticed, an
  appendage of a Wampa Ice Monster suddenly detaches from
  a seemingly solid section of ice wall.

          LEIA

    Han!

  Han stops in the quiet corridor and turns to face Leia.

          HAN
    Yes, Your Highness?

          LEIA
    You said you were going to stay.
    What happened?

          HAN
    That bounty hunter we ran into
    on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

          LEIA
    Does Luke know?

          HAN
    He'll know when he gets back ...
    Don't give me that look.  Every
    day more bounty hunters are
    searching for me.  If I don't
    pay off Jabba soon, there'll be
    too many to stop ... Remotes,
    Gank killers, and who knows what
    else.  I've got to get that price
    off my head while I still have a head.

          LEIA
    Han, we need you here.

          HAN
    We?

          LEIA
    Yes.

          HAN
    Not you?

          LEIA
      (mystified)
    Me?  I don't know what you mean.

          HAN
      (shakes his head, fed-up)
    You probably don't.  How could
    you?  You're so terrified of your
    own emotions ...

          LEIA
    And what are they, pray tell?

          HAN
    You want me to stay because of
    the way you feel about me.

          LEIA
    I respect you.  You're a bold
    fighter, maybe not the brightest,
    but ...
          HAN
    No, your worship.. That's not
    what I'm talking about.

  Leia stares at him, understands, then laughs.

          LEIA
    You're imagining things.

  Han has had it with this broad.  He steps closer.
  Leia is almost against the wall.  Han puts a hand
  against the wall to cut off any retreat.

          HAN
    Am I?  I say you came running
    after me because you were afraid
    I was leaving you without even a
    kiss.

          LEIA
    I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.

          HAN
    There's no accounting for taste.
    Believe me, you could use a good
    kiss.
      (warming to the subject)
    You've spent so much time doing
    your duty and giving orders you've
    never learned how to be a woman.
    It's a shame, because you've got
    all the makings for one.  I could
    have helped you plenty in that
    department ... if you'd have let
    go for a minute.  But it's too
    late now, sweetheart.  Your big
    opportunity is flying out of here.

          LEIA
    We are fighting for a cause much ...

          HAN
    Spare me please!  Don't tell me
    about the Rebellion again.  I've
    had it with your noble mission.
    All you let yourself think about
    is the Rebellion.  The result is
    you're as cold as this planet.

          LEIA
    And you think you're the one to
    apply some heat?

          HAN
    Sure ... If I were interested.
    But I don't think it'd be much fun.

  He steps away from her, takes a last cool appraisal.

          HAN (Continued)
    We'll meet again.  Maybe you'll
    have grown up a little by then.

          LEIA
    You have all the breeding of a
    Bantha, but not as much class ...
    Enjoy your trip, hot shot!

  Leia walks away.

16  EXT ICE PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY         16

  Track with the sinister, probe robot as it moves across
  the vast frozen wilderness.  One of its extended sensors
  detects something and the robot stops, turns and heads
  off in another direction, at high speed.


17  EXT MOUND OF SNOW - ICE PLAIN - HOTH - DAY      17

  The robot stops before a large mound of snow about
  twenty feet long and six feet high.  It circles the
  mound, then shoots a thin laser bolt at the snow drift.

18  CLOSE-UP MOUND OF SNOW            18

  The mound shakes a little bit and two large eyes appear
  at one end, staring directly at the robot.  A primeval
  BELLOW issues forth from the mound.

19  EXT MOUND OF SNOW - ICE PLAIN - HOTH - DAY      19

  The robot backs off a few feet, then blasts the mound
  with a heavy laser bolt that disintegrates the snow-
  covered creature in a cloud of smoke and flame.

20  EXT ICE PLAIN - HOTH - DAY        20

  The evil robot moves off toward the horizon.

21  EXT ICE GORGE - HOTH - DUSK         21

  The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the
  dim twilight of a Hoth day.  Luke hangs spreadeagle
  upside down, ankles tied by hide thongs to ice
  stalactites, his extended arms within a meter of the snow
  floor.  His face is covered in dried frozen blood on one
  side.  He opens his eyes as a chilling MOAN of the
  hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.

22  EXT ICE GORGE - MED SHOT LUKE - DUSK      22

  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
  futilely tries to unfasten the thongs.  Exhausted, he
  drops back into the hanging position.

          LUKE
      (to himself)
    Relax.  Relax.

  Luke spies his laser sword lying near a pile of his
  discarded gear about three feet out of reach.  Rever-
  berating through the gorge, the growling and crunching
  sounds of the approaching ice monster can be heard.
  Luke desperately strains for his sword.  Quietly, almost
  a whisper, Luke hears old BEN'S CALM VOICE.

          BEN (Voice Over)
    Luke, think the saber in your
    hand.

  Luke focuses on the saber as the huge monster's feet
  crunch closer.  Luke's hand strains toward the weapon,
  his eyes squeeze tight in concentration.

          LUKE
    Gotta relax, relax ....

          BEN (Voice Over)
    Let The Force flow, Luke.

  Just as the ice monster looms over Luke, the light
  saber suddenly jumps three feet into Luke's hand.  The
  young warrior instantly ignites the sword, swings up
  and cuts both of his bindings.  He drops to the snow in
  a heap.  The startled ice monster moves back, his giant
  yellow eyes blinking.  The most that can be discerned
  of the creature is a shape, and those two perplexed eyes.
  Luke scrambles to his feet.  He swings his light saber
  and the monster screams in pain.

23  EXT ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - HOTH - DUSK   23

  Luke staggers out of the gorge and stumbles down a
  snow bank.

24  INT MAIN HANGAR DECK - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK   24

  The hangar is full of activity.  We hear a familiar
  stream of beeps and whistles a moment before catching
  sight of ARTOO and THREEPIO, who appear from a corridor
  and move along an ice wall toward the Millennium Falcon.
  Behind them, in the ice, two large yellow eyes blink
  open.

          THREEPIO
    It is not my fault, you malfunc-
    tioning twerp.  I merely commented
    That it was freezing in her chamber.
    But it's supposed to be freezing.
    I did not ask you to turn on the
    thermal heater. I don't know how
    we'll get all her things dried out
    ... Ah. Here we are.

  The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.
  Han and Chewie are still struggling with their central
  lifters.

          THREEPIO
    Captain Solo, sir. Might I have
    a word with you?

          HAN
    What is it?

          THREEPIO
    Mistress Leia has been trying to
    reach you on the communicator,
    but either you have it turned off,
    or it is malfunctioning ... if
    it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it,
    if you like.

          HAN
    I shut it off.  What's her royal
    holiness want?

          THREEPIO
    She is looking for Master Luke,
    and assumed he would be here with
    you.  No one seems to know ...

  Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of
  the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the
  planet.

          HAN
      (concerned)
    Luke's not back yet?  It's almost
    night out there!

  Han jumps down off the lift.

          HAN
    Bolt it down, Chewie ...
      (yelling)
    Deck Sergeant!
      (into com-link)
    Control, has Commander Skywalker
    reported in yet?

  He gets a negative reply as the DECK SERGEANT and an
  AIDE rush up to Han.

          DECK SERGEANT
    Yes sir!

          HAN
    Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker
    back yet?

          DECK SERGEANT
    I haven't seen him.  He probably
    came in through the south entrance.

          HAN
    Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant.
    Check on it!

  The Deck Sergeant and his aide turn and rush off.
  Artoo lets out a confused whistle.

          THREEPIO
    I don't know, Artoo.
      (to Han)
    Sir, might I inquire what's going
    on?

          HAN
    Go tell your precious Princess ...
    Luke is dead unless he shows up
    soon.

  Artoo lets out with a hysterical whistle.

          THREEPIO
    Oh no!

25  INT MAIN HANGAR DECK - TAUNTAUN CORRAL - NEAR ENTRANCE    25
  DUSK

  The Deck Sergeant and several Troopers inspect the
  mangled remains of three dead Tauntauns.  Some of the
  hardware nearby has also been brutally pulled out of
  shape.  Several surviving Tauntauns shuffle nervously
  nearby.  Outside the light is slowly fading.

          TROOPER
      (to Deck Sergeant)
    ... I can't imagine, sir.  Their
    necks are broken.

  The Deck Sergeant nods, then notices Han running up
  and steps out of the group to meet him.

          DECK SERGEANT
    Commander Skywalker hasn't come
    through the south entrance, sir.
    Maybe he slipped by without
    checking in.

          HAN
    Not likely!  Where are the
    speeders?

          DECK SERGEANT
    We haven't got them adapted to
    this cold yet ...

          HAN
    We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.

          DECK SERGEANT
    The temperature is dropping too
    fast.

          HAN
    You bet it is ... and Luke's out
    in it.

  Han pushes through the troops and mounts a snow lizard.
  Huge monster feet move into the shadows of one of the
  X wing bays.

          DECK SERGEANT
    The night storms will start before
    you can reach the first marker.

          HAN
    Then I'll see you in Hell.

26  EXT SNOW CAVE ENTRANCE - REBEL BASE - DUSK      26

  The small, lone figure riding a snow lizard races off
  into the hostile vastness of snow and cold.  The
  slightest hint of wind blows up the snow behind the
  Tauntaun.

27  EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - DUSK        27

  The dark, evil probe robot moves across the frozen
  floor of the Hoth plain.  The wind is beginning to
  pick up, and snow starts to cake on the front of the
  robot.  It stops, hovers, then drops to the ground.
  Several probes emerge from its metal hull and a dome
  shaped force field around the robot begins to glow.
  Eventually, the force field becomes a solid shape and
  is quickly covered with the blowing snow.

28  EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - DUSK        28

  Han rides across the plain on his Tauntaun.

29  EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - CLOSE-UP HAN - DUSK   29

  He reigns his mount to a stop, looks around and listens.
  It's almost as if he hears something.  He turns and looks
  in one direction, then spurs his lizard in that direction.

30  EXT PLAIN OF HOTH - DUSK        30

  Han rides off across the plain on his Tauntaun.

31  EXT SNOW DRIFT - HOTH - DUSK        31

  The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to
  stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him
  over.  He struggles to get up, but can't.  The young
  warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet
  and then collapses.

          LUKE
    I can't ...

          BEN
    You must.  Luke, look at me!

  Luke looks up and sees old BEN KENOBI standing not ten
  feet away.  Luke strains to lift himself up.  He is
  speechless.

          BEN
    You must survive, Luke.

          LUKE
    I'm cold ... so cold ...

          BEN
    You must go to the Dagobah System
    ... There you will learn from
    one who taught me:  Yoda, the
    Jedi Master.

          LUKE
    Ben ... Ben ...

          BEN
    Luke ... you are the only hope.

  The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone rider on a
  Tauntaun in the windswept horizon.

          LUKE
    Ben!?

  Luke drops into unconsciousness.

32  EXT SNOW DRIFT - HOTH - DUSK        32

  Han pulls up, leaps off his lizard.  He goes to his
  snow-covered friend and cradles him in his arms.  Han's
  Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow.  There is real
  fear in Han's face as he shakes Luke.

          HAN
    Come on, buddy, you aren't dead
    yet.  Give me a sign here.

  Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing
  Luke's wounded face.  Soon he is slapping him.

          HAN
    Don't do this, Luke, it's not your
    time ...

  Luke responds to a slap.  Han is joyous.

          HAN
    All right!  I knew you wouldn't
    leave me out here all alone!

  Han glances over toward his Tauntaun with concern as
  he starts to lift Luke.

          HAN
      (to Luke)
    We've got to get you out of here
    before our transportation freezes.

33  EXT SNOW DRIFT BY TAUNTAUN - HOTH - DUSK      33

  Han has carried Luke almost to the lizard when the
  Tauntaun dies with a moan.  Han checks the lizard.

          HAN
    Blast!  Deader than a Triton moon.
    We haven't got much time.

  Han ignites Luke's light saber and cuts the beast from
  head to toe.  He quickly shovels the steaming innards
  of the beast into the snow.  Then he lifts Luke's inert
  form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

          HAN
    I know this doesn't smell so good,
    Luke, but it'll keep you from
    freezing.  I'm sure this Tauntaun
    wouldn't hesitate if it were the
    other way around.
      (Han gets an awful
        whiff of the insides)
    Whew!  It's just as well you're
    out, pal.

  Han starts pulling things out of a pack on the dead
  lizard's back.

          HAN
      (into com-link)
    Base one, do you copy? ...
    This com-link is useless.

  The wind has picked up considerably and Han is beginning
  to find it difficult to move.  He struggles with the
  shelter container, opens it and starts constructing it.

          HAN
    If I don't get this shelter up
    fast, Jabba the Hutt won't need
    those bounty hunters.

34  SNOW DRIFT - HOTH - DUSK        34

  A veil of icy snow flows across the snow drift obscuring
  the doomed warriors.

35  INT MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT   35

  Princess Leia and her two robots stand before the dark
  entrance to the rebel base, waiting for a sign of the
  two rebel heroes.  Leia shivers as the cold wind blows
  in on her.  Artoo beeps a mournful tone.  Chewie is
  sitting nearby with his head in his hands.

          THREEPIO
    Artoo can pick up no signals,
    although he feels his range is
    probably too limited to give up
    hope.

  Leia nods an acknowledgement, but she is lost in thought
  that is only broken when General Rieekan approaches.

          RIEEKAN
    Nothing more can be done tonight.
    The shield doors must be closed.
    I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.

          LEIA
      (resigned)
    I understand.

  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a
  coyote.

          RIEEKAN
    The speeders should be ready in
    the morning.  They'll make the
    search easier.

          LEIA
    Is there any chance of them
    surviving out there?

          RIEEKAN
    Slim, but yes, there's a chance.
    They have a shelter.  It's not
    much, but ...

  Artoo lets out with a complex series of efficient beeps.

          THREEPIO
    Beggin' your pardon, ma'am, but
    Artoo says the chances of survival
    are one thousand, seven hundred
    twenty-seven to one.
      (to Artoo)
    Actually, I don't think we needed
    to know that.

  Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors
  slam across the entrance of the ice cave.  The loud
  BOOMS echo through the huge cavern.  Chewie lets out
  another howl.

36  EXT ICE PLAIN - HOTH - DAWN         36

  The huge dim sun of Hoth crawls lazily over the horizon
  in the North as a spurt of snow shoots skyward
  revealing the dark probe robot.  The sinister object
  pulls in several of its extended arms, hovers for a
  few moments, then starts off across the bleak Hoth plain.

37  EXT SNOWDRIFT - HOTH - DAY        37

  A small, snub-nosed, armored landspeeder races across
  the white landscape.

38  INT ARMORED SNOWSPEEDER - HOTH SNOWDRIFTS - DAY   38

  There is only one PILOT, ZEV, in the enclosed two-man
  craft.  He concentrates on the scopes which ring his
  cockpit.  A low beep can be heard.

          ZEV
      (excited)
    I've got something!  Not much but
    it could be a life form  FTC 2321
    by TRX 1173.  I'm closing in ...

39  EXT ARMORED SNOWSPEEDER - HOTH SNOWDRIFTS - DAY   39

  The small craft banks and makes a slow arc racing off
  in a new direction.

40  INT ARMORED SNOWSPEEDER - HOTH SNOWDRIFTS - DAY   40

  The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

          ZEV
    This is S-122 calling Captain
    Solo, Commander Skywalker. Do
    you copy?  This is S-122 ...

  There is a sharp crackle of static then a faint voice.

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    Nice of you guys to drop by.  Hope
    we didn't get you up too early.

          ZEV
      (switching transmitters)
    Base One, I found them,  Repeat,
    I found them ....

41  EXT SNOWDRIFT - HOTH - DAY        41

  The small shelter is covered with snow on the windward
  side.  Han has made a makeshift antenna which rests
  gingerly on top of the snowdrift.  The small armored
  speeder can be seen approaching in the distance as Han
  waves frantically in the foreground.

42  INT MEDICAL CENTER - REBEL BASE       42

  Strange ROBOT SURGEONS adjust a mass of electronic
  equipment.  A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding
  flash obscures Luke in a chamber filled with a thick,
  gelatinous red slime.  Luke begins to thrash about,
  raving in his delirium.

43  INT MEDICAL CENTER OBSERVATION ROOM - REBEL BASE    43

  Leia, Threepio, and Chewbacca are watching from a
  glassed-off room next door, where Han is resting on a
  cushioned medical table.  They can hear the mechanical
  surgeons working and Luke's ravings on a speaker in
  the room.

          LUKE
    Watch out ... snow creatures ...
    dangerous ... Yoda ... go to Yoda
    ... only hope ... must survive ....

  Han raises himself on the table, listening to Luke.
  Chewbacca makes him lie back down, then BARKS a comment
  in reference to Luke.

          HAN
    He doesn't make sense to me either,
    Chewie.

          THREEPIO
    I do hope he's all there ... if
    you take my meaning.  I would hate
    to see Master Luke develop a short
    circuit ...

          HAN
    The kid ran into something mean,
    and it wasn't the cold.

          LEIA
    Those creatures he keeps talking
    about ... we'd better double the
    security ... Han, I don't know
    how ...

          HAN
    Forget it.

  TOO-ONEBEE (2-1B), a surgeon droid, enters the room.

          TOO-ONEBEE
    He had gone into dormo-shock,
    almost hibernation.  But he's
    responding to the Bacta.  We'll
    bring him through.

  Leia breathes a sigh of relief.  Chewie lets out a long
  GRUNT of approval.

          LEIA
    Now all we've got to worry about
    is what attacked him.

          HAN
    No kidding.  If this snowball's
    got nasty natives, they could be
    anywhere.

  Chewie WHINES, looks around.

          HAN
    That's right, Chewie, inside the
    base.

44  INT CORRIDOR - REBEL BASE         44

  The drip, drip, drip of melting ice echoes throughout
  the long eerie corridor.  A trooper walks by, followed
  at a short distance by Artoo, who rolls along whistling
  to himself. Behind him, a Wampa Ice Monster suddenly
  appears from out of the wall and begins following the
  little droid.  Up ahead Artoo sees several troopers
  begin to act rather strangely, pointing at him and
  yelling.  This puzzles Artoo, and he stops for a moment
  to figure it out.  Far in the distance, alarms begin to
  go off.

  Artoo comes to a conclusion, spins his head around and
  sees the Ice Monster staring down at him.  The droid
  lets out a screech and races down the hall at full tilt
  ahead of the advancing monster.

  A small troop of soldiers has gathered at the end of the
  hallway with weapons.  Artoo races through the armed
  gathering as the creature screams and charges the
  troopers, laser bolts exploding around him.  Artoo peeks
  from around a corner in time to see several troopers
  hurled against the walls like rag dolls.  Two soldiers
  fire a laser bazooka at the monster and it is obscured
  by an enormous explosion.

  The smoke clears.  The silence is spooky.  The Ice
  Monster stands seemingly dumbstruck.  Artoo gives a short,
  worried beep.  The creature topples over in a dead heap.
  A cheer goes up from Artoo and the troopers as they
  converge to inspect the fallen creature.  A young CORPORAL
  pulls his com-link off his belt and speaks into it.

          CORPORAL
    We got it, sir, but there may be
    more.

45  INT COMMAND CENTER - REBEL BASE       45

  Alarms buzz softly in the background.  The entire command
  center is on full alert.  General Rieekan is conferring
  with the HEAD CONTROLLER as Han and Leia enter the room.
  Threepio and Chewie follow.

          LEIA
    Have they analyzed the one that
    was killed?

          RIEEKAN
    Not yet.  They're working on it
    now.

  Another alarm goes off at a console behind them and the
  SENSOR CONTROLLER at that spot calls across the room.

          SENSOR CONTROLLER
    General!

  Rieekan leaves the group as they continue ...

          HEAD CONTROLLER
    It won't be long before our sensors
    will be able to track them.

          THREEPIO
    It figures Artoo would be in the
    middle of this.

          HAN
    It's going to be a little tricky
    around here until we know where
    they're coming form.

46  INT COMMAND CENTER BY CONSOLE - REBEL BASE      46

  Rieekan looks up grimly from the console in the back-
  ground.  He calls over to Leia and Han.

          RIEEKAN
    We have a visitor.

  The group hurries over to Rieekan.

          RIEEKAN
    We've picked up something outside
    the base in zone one, moving East.

          LEIA
    What is it?

          SENSOR CONTROLLER
    Can't tell yet ... Metal.

          HAN
    Then it's not one of those creatures.

          LEIA
    Could it be one of ours?  A speeder?

          SENSOR CONTROLLER
    I'm getting no signal.  Wait,
    something very weak.

  Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens to
  the strange signal intensely.

          THREEPIO
    I must say, sir, I'm fluent in
    over six million forms of communi-
    cation, but this is something new
    ... must be in code or ....

  A new VOICE comes over the com-link.

          TROOPER VOICE
    This is station five and we have
    your object on our scopes ...
    It's just over the ridge, we
    should have visual contact in
    about ... What the? ... Oh no!

  The transmission ends in static.

          HAN
    Whatever it is, it isn't friendly.
    I'm going to have a look.  Come on,
    Chewie.

          RIEEKAN
    Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

          HAN
      (over his shoulder)
    Fine.  But they'll have to take
    care of themselves.

47  EXT SNOW PLAIN - OVER REBEL BASE - HOTH - DAY   47

  The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of
  the station fire and down a ridge toward the rebel base.

48  EXT SNOW PLAIN - SPEEDER - OVER REBEL BASE - HOTH - DAY   48

  The robot stops when it sees in the distance a tiny
  speeder racing toward it followed by several other
  speeders. A large antenna projects skyward from the
  robot's top and it begins to send out a PIERCING SIGNAL.

49  EXT SNOW DUNE - SPEEDER - HOTH - DAY      49

  The speeder disappears behind a snow dune.

50  EXT SNOW PLAIN - OVER REBEL BASE - HOTH - DAY   50

  The sinister robot continues to send out its high pitched
  signal while frantically searching the landscape for the
  rebel speeders.

51  EXT SNOW PLAIN - OVER REBEL BASE - HOTH - DAY   51

  Shortly, Chewbacca pops his head over a snow bank not
  thirty feet away.  The robot swings around, its deadly
  ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot off,
  it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in
  a million pieces.

52  EXT SNOW PLAIN - OVER REBEL BASE - HOTH - DAY   52

  Han Solo rises from the direction of the deadly bolt
  and walks over to the spot where the robot was a moment
  before, taking out his com-link.

53  INT COMMAND CENTER - REBEL BASE       53

  Princess Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the com-link.

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    .... I'm afraid there's not much
    left.

          LEIA
    What was it?

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
    it that hard.  It must have had a
    self-destruct ....

          LEIA
    An Imperial probe droid.

          HAN (OS)
      (filtered)
    Now don't panic.  We don't know
    that.

          RIEEKAN
    But, we don't know it wasn't.

54  SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET            54

  Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and stranger than
  the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits
  in the vastness of space.  The six huge ships are
  surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft.  Tie
  fighters dart to and fro.

55  INT BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER   55

  Controllers working the vast complex of electronic
  controls hear ominous, approaching footsteps and look
  up from their controls.  The squat, evil-looking
  ADMIRAL OZZEL and the young, powerfully-built GENERAL
  VEERS, who have been conferring near the front, also
  feel the approaching presence and turn that way. DARTH
  VADER, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind. As
  he moves across the wide bridge, CAPTAIN PIETT hurries
  up to Ozzel.

          PIETT
    I think we've found them, Admiral.

          OZZEL
    Are you sure, Captain?

          PIETT
    Well, the report we have is only
    a fragment, from a probe droid in
    the Hoth System, but it's the best
    lead we've had in ....

          OZZEL
      (angry)
    We have millions of probe droids
    searching the galaxy ... I want
    proof, not leads.  I don't intend
    to continue to chase around from
    one side ....

          VADER
      (looming over the group)
    The Hoth System?

          PIETT
    Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ...
    the System is supposed to be devoid
    of human forms ...

  On a large screen, an image of the rebel snow base
  appears surrounded by complicated computer readouts.
  The rebel speeders can be seen approaching in the
  distance.  Vader studies the image.

          VADER
    That's it.  That's the one.

          OZZEL
    My Lord, how do you know it's
    them?  There are so many uncharted
    settlements.  It could be smugglers ...

          VADER
    I know.  And I know young Skywalker
    is with them.  Bring in the patrol
    ships, Admiral, and set your course
    for the Hoth System.  General Veers
    prepare your men ....

56  INT ICE CORRIDOR - REBEL BASE - HOTH      56

  Artoo and Threepio are moving by a steel door on which
  an X had been painted.  From behind it come intermittent
  THUMPS and ROARS.

          THREEPIO
    ... It seems the snow creatures
    are attracted to a high-pitched
    whistle.  That's how they're being
    drawn to this trap.

  Artoo WHISTLES his understanding as he stands before
  the door.  Immediately the THUMPING on the door picks
  up.  Artoo beeps a question.

          THREEPIO
    See your whistles upset them.
    No, I told you they can't get out!
    Now will you hurry up?  I don't
    know why I bother ...

  Threepio moves around a corner.  Artoo stares at the
  door another moment, then proceeds to tell the Ice
  Monsters off in a burst of beeps and whistles.  The
  THUMPING picks up as Artoo moves casually away.

57  INT MEDICAL CENTER - REBEL BASE       57

  Luke is out of the chamber, lying on the bed previously
  occupied by Han.  Leia is at his side.  She brushes the
  hair out of his eyes and runs her fingers along the scar
  on his face.

          LEIA
    The Bacta are growing well.  The
    scars should be gone in a day or
    so.  Does it still hurt?

          LUKE
    I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when
    I was out there and it looked
    pretty bad ... well, it made me
    think about things.

          LEIA
    Me too.  I was afraid.

  Their eyes meet. Luke touches her cheek with his hand.

          LUKE
    I don't really know how to say this
    ... I never have before ... Leia,
    you know how I feel about you ...

  She does and it's confusing.  Their lips are very close.
  About to kiss.  The door opens noisily and Threepio
  enters with Artoo.  Leia pulls back, startled.  Luke
  realizes the moment has been lost.  His mind races for
  a way to regain it as Leia takes on her more formal
  manner.  The droids are a bothersome distraction; Luke's
  concentration is on Leia.  Artoo beeps a cheerful
  greeting.

          THREEPIO
    Master Luke, it's so good to see
    you functional again.

          LUKE
    Thanks, Threepio.  Leia ...

  Artoo beeps and whistles.

          THREEPIO
    Artoo expresses his relief also.

          LUKE
    Good.  Thanks, Artoo.

          LEIA
      (about to leave)
    You rest now.

          THREEPIO
    So much has happened during the
    period of your indisposition, sir.

          LEIA
    I'll be back later.

          LUKE
      (anxious to keep her)
    Leia ... What would you think if
    I went away for a while?

          LEIA
    What did you say?!

  Leia's reaction is so much bigger and more vociferous
  than Luke expected, it starts what is to become a growing
  snowball of confusion for him.

          LEIA
    Where are you going?

          LUKE
    I have this ... feeling.  I'm
    not sure, really ...

          LEIA
    That's just great.  Why doesn't
    everyone just take off?

          LUKE
    What are you talking about?

          LEIA
    First Han, now you.  When am I
    going to learn not to count on
    anyone but myself? ...

          LUKE
    Han's leaving?

          LEIA

    ... I was getting along just fine
    before I met you two moon jockeys.

          LUKE
    Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about
    Han.

          LEIA
    He wants to pay off that criminal
    he's in hock to.

          LUKE
    Jabba the Hutt?

          LEIA
      (back to her tirade)
    I could get more loyalty if I
    went down the hall and recruited
    some of those snow creatures.

          LUKE
    Snow creatures ... they're here?!

          THREEPIO
    Yes, sir.  But they're being trapped
    quite cleverly.

  Artoo beeps and whistles proudly.

          THREEPIO
      (to Artoo)
    What do you mean, you took care
    of that?  I would hardly call your
    part in that matter great ...

  Luke's head is spinning as Han and Chewie make a vigorous
  entrance.  The Wookiee GROWLS a greeting.

          HAN
    Hi kid, you look strong enough
    to wrestle a Gundark.

          LUKE
    Thanks to you.

          HAN
    That's two you owe me, junior.

  Han turns to Leia with a big, devilish grin.

          HAN
    Well, your worship, it looks like
    you arranged to keep me close by
    for a while longer.

          LEIA
    I had nothing to do with it.  General
    Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any
    ships to leave the system until we
    know where that probe came from.

          LUKE
    Probe?  What probe?

          HAN
    That makes a good story.  But I
    think you just can't bear to let
    me out of your sight.

          LEIA
    I don't know where you get your
    delusions, laser brains.

  Chewie is amused; he LAUGHS in his manner.  Han is
  enjoying this.  He regards Chewie good-humoredly.

          HAN
    Laugh it up, fuzz ball.  You didn't
    see her alone with me in the south
    passage.

  Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

          LEIA
      (to Luke)
    I don't know what he's talking
    about.

          HAN
    Ooops!  I guess you haven't told
    Luke about that yet.

          LUKE
    About what?

          HAN
    Now don't get the wrong idea, pal.
    She was just trying to express
    her true feelings for me.

          LEIA
      (to Han)
    You must have gone completely out
    of your feeble mind.

          HAN
    Come on, your highness, are you
    telling me you haven't been thinking
    about that kiss?

  Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke And Han.

          LEIA
    Why you low-down, stuck-up, half-
    witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.

          HAN
    Who's scruffy-looking?
      (a big grin)
    I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've
    hit pretty close to the mark to
    get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't
    it look that way to you, Luke?

          LUKE
      (staring at Leia)
    Yeah ... it does ... kind of.

  Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask again,
  focusing on Luke.

          LEIA
    Oh it does, does it?  Well, I
    guess you don't understand every-
    thing about women yet ... do you,
    sonny?

  With that Leia leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.
  Then she stands and walks out.  Everyone is dumbstruck.
  The door closes behind Leia and they all look at each
  other in silence.

  In the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

58  SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET            58

  Six huge star destroyers rest in the Hoth
  System.

59  INT STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER      59

  A dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light
  from above.  The brooding Dark Lord sits on a raised
  meditation cube.  General Veers enters the room and
  approaches Vader.  Vader doesn't move.  Veers, although
  seemingly very sure of himself, is still not bold enough
  to interrupt the meditating Lord.  The young general
  stands quietly at attention until the evil presence
  speaks.

          VADER
    What is it, Veers?

          VEERS
    My Lord, the fleet has moved out
    of light speed.  Com-Scan has
    detected an energy field protecting
    an area on the sixth planet in the
    Hoth System.  The field is strong
    enough to deflect any bombardment.

          VADER
      (angry)
    The rebel scum is alerted to our
    presence.  I told Admiral Ozzel
    not to go out of light speed so
    close to the system.

          VEERS
    He felt surprise was a wiser ...

          VADER
    He's as clumsy as he is stupid.
    A clean bombardment is impossible
    with that energy shield up.  Prepare
    your troops for a surface attack.

  Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large
  view-screen showing the bridge of the mighty space
  cruiser.  Admiral Ozzel appears, with Captain Piett
  in the background.

          OZZEL
    Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
    out of light ...

          VADER
    Captain Piett!

  The Captain steps forward, as the Admiral moves away
  slightly confused, touching his throat as it begins
  to constrict.

          PIETT
    Yes, My Lord.

          VADER
    Make ready to land General Veers'
    assault troops on the surface.
    Then deploy the fleet so that
    nothing can get off that system.
    You're in command now, Admiral
    Piett.

  Piett is as pleased as he is surprised.  Admiral Ozzel
  has been struggling to breathe in the background and
  now with a final choke, he dies.

60  INT MAIN HANGAR DECK - REBEL BASE       60

  Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews and droids rush
  to their alert stations.  Armored landspeeders are
  lined up in attack formation near the main entrance.
  Leia is briefing a group of pilots gathered in the
  center of the hangar.  Beyond them Han can be seen
  doing some frantic welding on the lifters of the
  Millennium Falcon.

          LEIA
    ... the large transport ships will
    leave as soon as they've loaded.
    Only two fighter escorts per ship.
    The energy shield can only be

  Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.
  He pulls out his com-link, all the time eyeing the lifters.

          HAN
      (into com-link)
    All right, Chewie, give it a try.

  Leia passes, giving Han a dirty look.  A mechanism on
  the pirate's ship makes a noise and the lifters begin
  to rise.  Suddenly there is a malfunction and the
  right lifter breaks partially loose, swinging down with
  a crash.  Han winces.  Leia, across the hangar, turns
  at the sound and shoots Han a ÒWhat a screw-up!Ó look,
  then goes out.

          HAN
      (into com-link)
    Hold it, Chewie.

62  INT COMMAND CENTER - REBEL BASE - HOTH      62

  The command center is quiet but tense, a marked contrast
  to the rushing about on the hangar deck.  Only the buzz
  of complicated electronic equipment overrides the silence.
  General Rieekan watches over the shoulder of a RADARMAN
  as hundreds of small dots dance across a scope readout.
  Leia joins him.

          RADARMAN

    that will be the end of our energy
    shield.

  Pilots, gunners and R-2 units hurry about.  Luke,
  pulling on his heavy weather gear, is headed toward a
  row of armored speeders.  He stops at the back of the
  Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are trying to
  repair the right lifter with even more haste than
  before.  Luke speaks up to them.

          LUKE
    Looks like this'll be it for awhile.
    Chewie, take care of yourself ...
    and watch over this guy, will ya.

  Chewie BARKS a farewell and returns to his work.  Han
  and Luke exchange warm looks.

          LUKE
    I hope you make your peace with
    Jabba.

          HAN
    Don't worry.  You haven't seen
    the last of us.

  Han swings down by one arm like a monkey and clasps
  Luke's hand.  They hold for a long moment, then break.
  Luke nods and moves away.  Han watches him go.

          HAN
    Give Ôem hell, kid.

  He goes back to work.  Everyone cheers at the announce-
  ment which echoes through the hangar.

          ANNOUNCER (OVER PA)
    First transport is clear and away.

  Luke hurries up to his landspeeder.  His gunner, DACK,
  a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They
  climb in.

          DACK
    Are you feeling all right, sir?

          LUKE
    Like new, Dack.  How Ôbout you?
    Ready to try some real fighting?

          DACK
    Yes, sir!  Right now I feel like
    I could take on the whole Empire
    myself.  You know what I mean,
    Commander?

          LUKE
      (quietly, strapping in)
    Yeah, I know ... I know.

  Leia's voice comes over the PA system.

          LEIA (OVER PA)

    are being towed to the south slope.
    They should be safe there.  You'll

    settled, everything falls apart.
    Well, I guess it's goodbye then ...
    Take good care of Master Luke ...
    and take good care of yourself,

          LUKE
    Just keep it steady.  Don't try
    to ....

  Luke's speeder is rocked by a huge explosion, and a
  loud metal scream drowns out Luke's sentence.  He

  every conceivable opening.  It sits dead in its tracks,
  smoking like a locomotive.

178 COMMAND CENTER - REBEL BASE         178

  The command center is a shambles.  The continual
  explosions outside have caused a massive cave-in.  A
  lone controller works at the remaining computer board,
  while Leia, Threepio and another controller attempt to
  move a cake of ice off of General Rieekan.  Finally,
  the ice tumbles to one side and Leia goes to the
  General, but it's too late.  Threepio inspects the
  General's pulse.

          THREEPIO
    I'm afraid he's no longer functioning.

  Leia is truly sorrowful.  She holds the General's hand a
  moment and regards him reflectively.

          CONTROLLER
      (urgent)
    The last transport is waiting.

  Another explosion rocks the area.

          THREEPIO
    Beg your pardon, ma'am, but our
    possible avenues of exit are
    being rapidly reduced.

  Leia nods, stands, and speaks to the controller with
  renewed authority.

          LEIA
    Tell the ship we're on our way,
    and signal the troops in the
    field to retreat to their fighters.

179 INT ICE CORRIDOR - REBEL BASE - HOTH

  Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the
  corridor is strangely quiet and empty.  Running foot-
  steps echo through the freezing hallway, then Han
  appears.  He hurries toward the Control Center just
  as Leia, Threepio and the two controllers exit the
  room.  Leia is surprised to see him.  Han is greatly
  relieved to see her.

          HAN
    ... I heard on the com-link the
    command station was destroyed.
    You all right?

  Leia nods, still a little confused.

          LEIA
    General Rieekan's dead.

  Han grimaces at the news, then looks them over.

          HAN
    This all that's left of your unit?
    You'd better hurry, the transport's
    waiting for you.

180 INT ICE CORRIDOR - REBEL BASE - HOTH      180

  With 3PO trailing behind, they race down the corridor
  to where it ends in a T and round the corner only to
  find it blocked with ice and snow.  They start back the
  other way when Han stops at a door with a big cross on
  it.

          HAN
    That way is going to take too long.
    Let's go through these storage rooms.

  He starts for the door and hears a faint banging.

          HAN
    Hey!  Someone's still in here.

          LEIA
    Wait, don't open it ... that's one
    of the traps for the ice creatures.

  The pounding increases.

          THREEPIO
    Oh my, there must be a hundred of
    them in there.

  They race down the corridor.

181 INT COCKPIT - REBEL TRANSPORT       181

  The pilots are getting nervous, the captain leans
  over one.

          CAPTAIN
    I don't know if there's anyone
    left alive in there.  Give it one
    more try.

          PILOT
    Control unit 33, this is transport
    XJ ... we can't wait any longer ....

182 INT ICE CORRIDOR            182

  Han pulls his com-link out and talks as he runs.

          HAN
    Hello, XJ!  They're coming now ...

  Suddenly there is an explosion, a loud crack.  Han turns,
  grabs the Princess and pulls her to the wall as a giant
  cave-in smothers the two controllers.

  Han grabs his com-link as Leia helps Threepio dig him-
  self out of the snow.

          HAN
    Transport XJ. get out of here.
    Go!

          THREEPIO
    The energy shield is down.  We'll
    be stuck here forever.

  com-link whistles.

  A distant, huge explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice
  cakes come crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.
  Chewie is pacing under the safety of the ship's landing
  gear.  The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his
  beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words.  Chewie
  searches in vain for his captain.  Something catches
  the Wookiee's eye and he lets out a loud SHRIEK.

  It is Han and Leia running toward the ship.  Chewie runs
  out into the falling ice, lets out another SHRIEK, then
  runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp
  after Chewie.  Threepio is not far behind.

203 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT - INT ICE CAVE    203

  Ice batters the cockpit windows as Chewie works at

          HAN
    I couldn't get back any faster.
    It's pretty shaky out there.

  Chewie starts chattering a mile a minute about something
  and points to one of the gauges.  Han looks worried.

          LEIA
    Would it help if I got out and
    pushed?

          HAN
    Don't worry, your holiness, I'll
    get her started.

  Threepio clanks into the hold.

          THREEPIO
    Sir, I was wondering if I might ...

          THREEPIO
    It can wait.

  Threepio turns and makes a hasty retreat.

    going to get us past that blockade.

          HAN
    This baby's got a few surprises
    left in her.

    You'll just have to switch over,
    and hope for the best.

  Chewie pulls back on the controls and the first stage
  of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at
  Leia as he swings past her into the pilot's seat.

  Leia straps herself into one of the navigator's chairs.

          LEIA

    like yours over there.

          WEDGE

  The pilots split up.  Luke waves as the others disappear
  in the windblown snow.  He walks on, and hears a familiar
  whistle coming from the vague silhouette of a fighter.

          LUKE

  Artoo chirps an excited acknowledgement as Luke climbs
  aboard the snow-covered spacecraft.  Artoo beeps his

    Two more Star Destroyers heading
    right at us.

          LEIA
    I'm glad you said there was going
    to be no problem, or I'd be worried.

  Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

          THREEPIO
    Sir, I was wondering ...

          HAN
    Sit down, and shut up!

          THREEPIO
    It can wait.

  FULL SHOT INT MILLENNIUM FALCON.  POV out window at
  two approaching Star Destroyers as they grow larger.
  Small flashes of light on the oncoming Star Destroyers
  turn into large flak bursts which rock the Falcon.  The
  Star Destroyers grow larger as they get ever closer.

          HAN
    Chewie, how's the deflector shield
    holding up?

  Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

          HAN
    Good ... at sub-light, they may
    be faster, but we can still out-
    maneuver them.  Hold on!

216 INT COCKPIT MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE       216

  CLOSE POV - out the Falcon cockpit window as the stars
  and looming Star Destroyers suddenly shift radically,
  rising through the top of the cockpit window as the

  Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over
  yet.  Chewie barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to
  find her stomach.  The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

          HAN
    That slowed them down a bit.  Chewie
    stand by to make the jump to light
    speed.

  The buffeting of the lasers becomes louder and stronger.

          LEIA
    They're getting awfully close ...

  an acute state of concern.

          LEIA

  Han tries again ... nothing.

          HAN
    I think we're in trouble.

          THREEPIO
    If I may say so, Sir, I noticed
    earlier that the entire main para-

    with the others.

  Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

          LUKE
    We're going to the Dagobah System.
      (Artoo beeps)
    We have enough power.
      (Artoo sing-songs
        a bit of chatter)
    They don't need us there.
      (Artoo beeps)
    I'm countermanding the order ...
    I'm a commander, remember.

  Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.
  He rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments
  to break the silence.  Finally, Artoo chirps up.

          LUKE
    Yes, Artoo.

  Artoo answers with a soft carefully-put phrase of
  whistles.

          LUKE
    Yes, Artoo, I know the Dagobah
    System doesn't appear on any of
    our navigational charts.  But,
    don't worry, it's there.
      (Artoo beeps a worried
        beep)
    I'm very sure .... trust me.

  Artoo lets out a limp little sigh.  The little droid
  is silent for a moment, as though thinking.  Then
  another beep.

          LUKE
    Yes, Artoo?
      (a carefully-put sentence
        of whistles)
    No ... no headache, I feel fine
    ... Why?
      (Artoo chirps an innocent
        phrase)
    No dizziness, no drowsiness, the
    scars are even gone ...
      (Artoo whistles a question)
    No, that's all right. Artoo, I'd
    rather keep it on manual control
    for awhile.

  Artoo lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke just smiles
  at his worried little friend.

          LUKE
    Trust me, Artoo.  I know where I'm
    going and I'll get us there safely ...
    it's not far.

    get out of this one.

  He gives Leia a glance, then a double take.

          LEIA
    I didn't say anything ....

  Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon,
  causing it to lurch radically.  Chewie barks louder.

    chance we need.

    seriously going into an asteroid
    field?

    Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart.
    We're gonna do some flyin'.

  Another asteroid thumps against the ship.  Leia winces.

          LEIA
    You don't have to do this to
    impress me.

          THREEPIO
    If I might remind you, sir, the
    probability of successfully navi-
    gating through an asteroid field
    is approximately 365,000 to one
    ... a graceful surrender might
    not be ...

  Chewie turns and barks at Threepio, who immediately
  shuts up.

  CLOSE-UP of asteroid as it tumbles away from the camera
  a fast speed.  When about 40 per cent of the screen is
  filled with the asteroid, several smaller asteroids
  crash into it from the side, creating small explosions
  on the surface.  Other asteroids in many sizes pass by
  in all directions, some colliding and creating
  explosions.  When the big asteroid is 20 per cent of
  the screen, the tiny Millennium Falcon appears from
  behind it, veers around the right side and races past
  camera on the left side through the rain of rocks,
  followed by the four Tie fighters, bobbing and weaving
  around the asteroids.

  Admiral Piett steps into the room and pauses at the
  sight of ...

  Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the
  gloom on the far side of the chamber.  A black, insect-
  looking droid attends him.  Among the various apparatus
  surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from
  Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass
  of ugly scar tissue covering it.  The black droid then
  lowers Vader's mask and helmet onto his head.  When it
  is in place, he turns.

          ADMIRAL PIETT
    Our pursuit ships have sighted the
    Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It
    has entered an asteroid field.

          VADER
    Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral.
    I want that ship, not excuses.  How
    long until you can have Skywalker
    and the others in the Millennium
    Falcon before me?

  the Falcon with a loud crunch.  Threepio's hands
  cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the cockpit
  window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the
  action.  Han gives her a quick look.

  buzzes in the background.  Artoo beeps and whistles
  frantically.

          LUKE
    I know, I know!  All the scopes
    are dead!  I can't see a thing ....
    Hang on, I'm going to start the

    hope there's something underneath
    us ....

  The blast of the retro rockets is deafening.  Artoo's
  squeals are barely heard.  Suddenly, there is a CRACKING
  sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then
  a tremendous splashing jolt as the spacecraft hits the
  surface.  Luke is considerably shaken, but all right.
  Artoo lets out a rattled little beep which shows up on
  the view screen.

          LUKE
    Yeah, I'm all right .... You still
    in one piece?
      (CLOSE-UP Artoo beeps

  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

271 EXT BOG - SWAMP - DUSK - DAGOBAH          271

  The mist-shrouded X wing fighter is barely visible,
  half buried in the murky swamp.  Luke climbs out onto
  the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out of
  his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys
  his hostile new environment.  Huge, twisted trees
  covered with vines and moss outline the misty landscape.

          LUKE
    Artoo, I wonder if that water is
    safe?

  Artoo lets out a short beep, then steps forward, loses
  his balance and disappears with a splash into the water.

          LUKE
    Artoo!

272 EXT SWAMP - DUSK            272

  Luke dives in near the spot where Artoo fell.  He
  surfaces and scans the water frantically until he sees
  a small periscope pop up.  The periscope turns until
  it gets a fix on Luke, then lets out a bubbling beep,
  and starts through the water toward the muddy beach.
  Luke follows.

273 EXT SWAMP - DUSK            273

  We see the POINT OF VIEW of an underwater swimming
  ÒthingÓ as it watches R-2 and his young master strug-
  gling toward shore.  R-2 is powered by two bubbling jets.

274 EXT SWAMP - DUSK            274

  A dark, ominously finned back breaks the surface.  Luke
  stops swimming for a second and sees the disturbing
  shape swimming toward him.  Luke swims for his life,
  racing past Artoo and finally scrambling up on shore.

          LUKE
    Hurry, Artoo!

275 EXT SWAMP - DUSK            275

  The thing swims up behind the little droid and dives,
  creating a loud clunk.  Artoo's periscope disappears as
  he lets out a pathetic electronic scream.  Luke wades a
  few feet into the murky pool looking for any sign of his
  little friend.  The black surface is as still as death
  itself .... a few bubbles begin to appear, then
  PHHEEWAATT!  The runt-sized robot is spit out of the
  water, makes a graceful arc and comes crashing down in
  a patch of moss.

          LUKE
    Artoo, are you okay?

  Artoo responds with a series of feeble whistles and tones.

          LUKE
    If you said you thought coming
    here was a bad idea, I'm beginning
    to agree with you.

276 EXT SWAMP - BEACH - DUSK        276

  Luke is shivering cold as the fog begins to close in.
  He helps little Artoo upright and starts to clean him
  off.  All is quiet except for an eerie and inhuman cry
  every once in awhile in the distance.  Both the robot
  and the boy glance around at the spooky swamp-jungle
  that surrounds them.  Sinister shadows move among the
  trees, as Luke notices a tiny, but vicious pair of eyes
  wink out and disappear in a scutter of feet.

          LUKE
    I'm sorry Artoo, I can't explain
    the urge that made me come here.
    It was part of a dream .... or
    .... maybe I'm just going crazy.

  surface of the ships.  One of the smaller Imperial
  vessels in the foreground gets hit by a huge asteroid
  and explodes.

280 INT BRIDGE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - MAIN CONTROL DECK   280

  INT FULL SHOT - Asteroids collide, creating fireworks
  display out bridge window.

  Darth Vader stands in the hologram cage above the
  control deck.  Before him are the hologram images of
  twenty Battleship Commanders.  One of these images,
  the Commander of the ship just exploded, is fading
  quickly away at this moment.  Another image, in the
  center and a little apart from the others, is faded and
  continually disrupted by static.  It is the Captain
  Needa of the Star Destroyer which was most hotly on the
  tail of the Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an
  aide stand behind the Dark Lord.

          CAPTAIN NEEDA (IN HOLOGRAM)
    .... which was the last time they
    appeared in any of our scopes.
    Considering the amount of damage
    we've sustained, they must have
    been destroyed ....

          VADER
    They're alive, Captain.  I know
    it and I want every ship available
    to sweep the asteroid field until
    they're found.

  The Imperial Star Captains fade off one by one as Vader
  turns to Admiral Piett.

          VADER
    Now what's so important it couldn't
    wait, Admiral?  Speak up!

  The Admiral is scared white as a sheet.  He's shaking.

          ADMIRAL
    It was .... the Emperor ....

          VADER
    The Emperor?

          ADMIRAL
    Yes, he commands you make contact
    with him ....

          VADER
    Move this ship out of the asteroid
    field and into a position where we
    can send a clear transmission.

          ADMIRAL
    Yes, My Lord.

          VADER
    And code the signal to my private
    chamber.

281 EST MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID CAVE       281

  The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid
  cave.  It is so dark, the exact dimensions are impos-
  sible to determine.

282 INT COCKPIT - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CAVE      282

  Han and Chewie are busy shutting down the engine and the
  electronic systems.  Threepio and Leia watch worriedly
  as all the service lights go out.  Han glances from the
  dimming lights to Leia with a quick grin.

          HAN
    Getting kinda romantic in here.

  Chewie suggests with a GROWL that Han pay attention to
  the business at hand.  Han returns to work.

          HAN
      (to Chewie)
    What are you so grouchy about?

          THREEPIO
    Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but
    does shutting down all but emergency
    power systems include me?

  Chewie BARKS yes, but Han think otherwise.

          HAN
    No, we're going to need you to
    talk to the ship and find out what
    happened to our hyperdrive ...
    How good are you with a macrofuser,
    Your Holiness?

  Suddenly the ship lurches, causing all the loose items
  in the cockpit to go flying.  Chewie HOWLS.

          LEIA
    A tremor!

          THREEPIO
      (to Han)
    Sir, it's very possible this
    asteroid is not stable.

          HAN
    I'm glad you're here to tell us
    these things ...

  The ship begins a violent motion.  Chewie HOWLS.

          HAN
    Hang on!  Watch out.

  The jolting movement throws Leia across the cabin into
  Han's arms.  The motion stops as suddenly as it started.
  Han and Leia realize they are in each others arms.  The
  pirate grins down at the girl.  Chewie watches the
  embrace with inscrutable interest.

          HAN
    Why, Princess, this is so sudden.

          LEIA
    Very funny.  You can let go now
    .... I'm getting angry.

          HAN
    You don't look angry.

          LEIA
    How do I look?

          HAN
      (with feeling)
    Beautiful.

  Leia flushes, averts her eyes.  She's not exactly
  fighting to get free.  But, of course, Han blows it ...

          HAN
    And excited.

  The anger rises in Leia.

          LEIA
    Sorry, Captain, being held by you
    isn't enough to get me excited.

          HAN
    Well, I hope you don't expect more.

          LEIA
    I don't expect anything, except to
    be left alone.

          HAN
    Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll
    have to let go.

  Han has lifted his arms lightly away, which makes it
  very clear that Leia has, in fact, been returning his
  embrace.  Leia realizes this and steps back, embarrassed
  and angry.  Her words are measured.

          LEIA
    Don't you think it's time we got
    to work on your ship ...

  She turns and leaves the cockpit.  Han turns to his
  faithful Wookiee, who's been watching all this with
  Threepio.

          HAN
    Come on, Chewie, let's tear into
    this flying short circuit before
    we get hit with another tremor.

  Chewie BARKS and starts out of the cockpit with Han.

          HAN
    You, too, golden rod.

          THREEPIO
    I must admit there are times I
    don't understand human behavior.

283 EXT BOG CLEARING - DUSK         283

  The mist has disappeared a bit, but it is still a gloomy
  looking swamp.  The X wing fighter has stopped sinking
  and is now only about one third above water.  A transfer
  cable has been rigged between the starfighter and the
  shore.  Artoo is on the back of the fighter sending a
  power case to Luke on the edge of the swamp.

          LUKE
    I think that will do it, Artoo.
    Come on back.

  Luke hears a loud snapping crash in the dense jungle
  right behind him.  It is too dark to see anything, but
  Luke already has his light saber in his hand, waiting
  to be ignited.  Nothing emerges from the obscure foliage
  so Luke clips his weapon back to his utility belt and
  continues to unpack the gear.  Meanwhile, Artoo has hooked
  a pulley from his midsection to the transport cable
  and is whizzing toward his master.  The stubby little
  droid lands with a beep.

          LUKE
    You ready for some power?

  Luke has ignited a little fusion furnace which throws
  off a warm glow.  He warms his hands, then plugs a
  power cable into Artoo's nose.  The droid whistles his
  appreciation.  Luke opens a container of processed food
  and sits before the thermal heater.

          LUKE
    Now all I have to do is find this
    Yoda .... if he even exists.

  Artoo beeps and Luke nervously looks around at the
  foreboding jungle.  He grimaces as he forces down
  the ill-tasting food.

          LUKE
    This seems like a strange place
    to find a Jedi master ... Gives
    me the creeps.
      (Artoo beeps ÒI'm with youÓ)
    ... There's something familiar
    about this place ... I feel like ...

          STRANGE VOICE
    You feel like what?

  Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.
  The young warrior grabs for his light saber as he spins
  around, looking for the speaker.  Mysteriously, standing
  right in front of Luke is a strange, blue creature, not
  more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing is
  dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

          LUKE
      (looking at creature)
    ... Like we're being watched.

          CREATURE
    Away put your weapon.  I mean you
    no harm.

  After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon,
  although he really doesn't understand why.  Artoo
  watches with interest.

          CREATURE (Continued)
    I'm wondering ... why are you
    here?

          LUKE
    I'm looking for someone.

          CREATURE
    Looking?  Looking?  You've found
    someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!

          LUKE
      (trying to keep from smiling)
    Yeah ...

          CREATURE
    Help you I can ... yes ... yes.

          LUKE
    I'm looking for a great warrior.

          CREATURE
    A great warrior?
      (shakes his head)
    Not many on those.  Wars don't
    make one great.

  Yoda jumps and lands on one of the cases of supplies.
  He begins to rummage around.

          LUKE
    Get away from there.

  Artoo moves to the edge of the case (almost eye level
  to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies)
  and squeaks his disapproval.

  The creature picks up the container of food Luke was
  eating from and takes a bite.

          LUKE
    Hey, that's my dinner!

  The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He
  makes a face.

          CREATURE
    Peewh!  Awful, awful.  Thank you,
    no.  How get you so big eating
    food of this kind?

  He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches
  into one of Luke's supply cases.

          LUKE
    Listen, friend, we didn't mean
    to land here, and if I could get
    my fighter out of this puddle I
    would, but I can't.  So ...

          CREATURE
    Can't get your ship out?  Have
    you tried?  Have you tried?

  The creature spots something of interest in Luke's
  case; Luke loses patience and grabs the case away.
  The creature retains his prize ... a tiny power lamp.
  The creature examines it with delight.

          LUKE
    Give me that!

          CREATURE
      (retreating with it)
    Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you
    not.

  Clutching the lamp, the creature backs away from Luke
  right into Artoo, who the creature barely recognizes
  as animate.  But as the following exchange takes place,
  one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the
  power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.

          LUKE
    I don't want your help.  I want
    my lamp back.  I'll need it in
    this slimy mudhole.

          CREATURE
    Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

  Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little
  figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over
  it.

          ARTOO
    Beeps a few Ògimme thats.Ó

          CREATURE
    Mine, mine.  Give it back.

  The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo
  lightly with one finger.

  Artoo reacts big with a squeal, and lets go.

          CREATURE
    Mine, mine.

          LUKE
      (fed up)
    Okay, Artoo, let him have it.
    Now get out of here, little
    fellow, we've got things to do.

          CREATURE
    No, no!  I'll stay and help you
    find your friend.

          LUKE
    I'm not looking for a friend.
    I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

          CREATURE
    Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different
    altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.

          LUKE
      (surprised and skeptical)
    You know the Jedi Master?

          CREATURE
    Of course, yes.  But now eat we
    must.  Good food, I have good
    food.  Come, come.

  With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing
  and down a path which is suddenly more apparent than
  before.  Luke looks after him, thinking, then starts
  that way.

          ARTOO
      (quite upset)
    Whistles a blue streak.

          LUKE
      (to Artoo)
    You'd better stay here and watch
    over the camp.

          ARTOO
    Beeps even more frantically.

  Luke is almost out of sight.  He yells back.

          LUKE
    Artoo, now settle down ... I can
    take care of myself ... I'll be
    safe ... okay?

  The little droid grows quiet as Luke disappears from
  view.

284 EXT BOG TRAIL - DUSK - DAGOBAH          284

  Down the misty trail, the creature moves along alone.

          CREATURE
    Heh ... safe ... heh ...
    quite safe (laughs) ... yes, of
    course.

  against a vast sea of stars.

286 INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER    286

  Darth Vader stands before a shimmering holographic
  image which slowly comes into focus.  The image is
  that of SATE PESTAGE, Grand Vizier to His Eminence,
  Emperor.

          VADER
    Sate Pestage, I would see the
    Emperor.  He commands it.

          PESTAGE
    I must warn you, Lord Vader,
    The Emperor is in a foul mood.
    He bids you wait.  Have you any
    progress to report?

          VADER
    The rebel base on Hoth has been
    destroyed.  I am tracking down
    the survivors.

          PESTAGE
    The Emperor will be with you in
    time.

          VADER
    I wait at his convenience.

287 EXT IMPERIAL CRUISER - ASTEROID BELT - SPACE    287

  FULL SHOT - Looking down on two medium-sized Imperial
  cruisers moving across the surface, dropping
  bombs which create powerful shock waves centered around
  blue explosions.

288 EXT IMPERIAL CRUISERS - CRATER - GIANT ASTEROID - SPACE   288

  The ships move over the crater in which the Millennium
  Falcon is hiding.  A faint ball of light emerges from
  the crater as a bomb hits bottom.

289 INT MAIN HOLD AREA - MILLENNIUM FALCON      289

  The ship rattles and vibrates.  Threepio is sitting at
  the main control panel.  The flooring and part of the
  ceiling have been removed revealing a section of the
  complex powertrain.  Chewie's head pops upside-down
  out of a bundle of wires in the ceiling.  He BARKS.
  Han looks up from where he's working in one of the
  floor compartments.  Princess Leia, who is welding
  something nearby, also stops working and looks up at
  Chewie.

          HAN
    That was no earthquake.

          LEIA
    Felt like a hydro concussion ...
    an Imperial Cruiser.

          THREEPIO
    Oh my, they've found us.

  Everyone is quiet for a moment, waiting for a second
  blast.  A very slight vibration is felt.

          LEIA
    They're moving away.

          HAN
    They're just trying to see if
    they can stir something up ...
    we're safe.

          LEIA
    Where have I heard that before?

  Han ignores her sarcasm and moves past her, rubbing
  against her in the tight quarters, to continue his
  work.  She watches him for a moment, then goes back
  to her welding.  Threepio whistles and beeps into the
  control panel in front of him and the control panel
  whistles back.

          THREEPIO
    Where is Artoo when I need him?
    I don't know where your ship
    learned to communicate, but its
    dialect leaves something to be
    desired.  It says the power
    coupling on the negative axis has
    been polarized.  You'll have to
    replace it, I'm afraid.

          CHEWIE
    Barks his understanding and
    returns to his wires.

  Leia finishes welding the valve she's been working on.
  She attempts to reengage the system by pulling on a
  lever attached to the valve.  It doesn't budge.  Han
  notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She
  rebuffs him.

          HAN
    Easy, your worship.  Only trying
    to help.

          LEIA
      (still struggling)
    Would you please stop calling
    me that?

  Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull
  on the lever.

          HAN
    Sure.  I guess I make it difficult
    sometimes.

          LEIA
    Yes, you do.

          HAN
    You could be a touch warmer,
    though.
      (he watches her reaction)
    Admit it, against your better
    judgment you think I'm all right.

  She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

          LEIA
      (a little smile, haltingly)
    Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally,
    when you aren't acting like a
    scoundrel.

          HAN
      (laughs)
    That's quite a compliment.

  With that, Han takes her hand, turns it over and presses
  his lips into her palm.

          LEIA
    Stop that.

          HAN
    Why?

  Leia is flushed, confused.

          LEIA
    My hands are dirty.

  Han kisses her hand again.  Leia yanks it away and
  steps back.  She can only move a few feet in the cramped
  space, but Han does not follow her.

          HAN
    What are you afraid of?

          LEIA
    Afraid of?  Certainly not you
    Captain Solo ... or any other
    man in this galaxy.

  Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never
  looked handsomer, more dashing, more confident.  He
  reaches out slowly and takes Leia's hand again from
  where it is resting on a console.  He draws it toward
  him.

          HAN
    Then why are you trembling?

  Then, with an irresistible combination of physical
  strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins
  to draw Leia toward him ... very slowly.

          HAN
    You know what I think?  I think
    you like me because I'm a scoundrel.
    I think you haven't run into enough
    scoundrels in your life.

  Leia is now very close and the following exchange takes
  place as their faces draw even nearer.  Leia's voice is
  and excited whisper, in complete opposition to what she's
  saying.

          LEIA
    Don't count on it.  I happen to
    like nice men.

          HAN
    Sure, they're safer.  You always
    know what they're going to do.
    Trouble is, it gets a little dull.

          LEIA
    There's nothing dull about a man
    I can depend on to be civilized.

          HAN
    You mean a man you can control.

          LEIA
    I do not!

          HAN
    Try and control this ...

  He kisses her now, with slow hot lips.  He takes his
  time, as though he had forever, bending her body back-
  ward.  She has never been kissed like this before, and
  it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she regains
  her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but
  finds it hard to talk.

          LEIA
    You're wrong ... This isn't what ...
      (he begins to kiss her again)
    ... not what I .... want ....

  His mouth stops her.  A swimming giddiness spins her
  around until, before she knows it, she is kissing him
  back.  Finally, Han breaks the kiss and looks at her.
  They stand there for a moment looking at each other.
  Leia is totally, frantically confused by her feelings.
  First with her eyes, then with her body, she withdraws,
  detaches from Han.  She slips from his arms and hurries
  from the cabin.

  Han stares after her thoughtfully, then turns his
  attention to the stuck lever.  He gives it a confident,
  mighty pull.  It doesn't budge.

          HAN
    Chewie!  Gimme a hand with this.

290 EXT BOG - EDGE OF SWAMP CAMP - DUSK       290

  A slight breeze moves the fog around in swirls.  Artoo
  is all alone.  The swamp had become even more fore-
  boding.  A light slapping sound can be heard across
  the water.  The tiny droid's head zips around looking
  for danger in every direction.  He feels very alone,
  and attempts to warm several of his utility arms in
  front of the thermal heater.  He whimpers a nervous
  little whistle.

291 EXT BOG MEADOW - CREATURE'S HOUSE - DUSK      291

  The gnarled trees thin out around a small moss-covered
  knoll where a strange, baroque mud house is built.  The
  small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its
  thick-glassed windows.

292 INT CREATURE HOUSE            292

  The inside of the house is very plain, but cozy.  Every-
  thing is in the same scale as the creature.  The only
  thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, who
  is cramped by the four foot ceiling.  He sits crossed-
  legged on the floor of the living room.

  The creature is in an adjoining area, which serves as
  the kitchen, cooking up some incredible meal.  The stove
  is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans.  The wizened
  little creature scurries about chopping this, shredding
  that and showering everything with exotic herbs and
  spices.  He rushes back and forth putting platters on
  the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature
  impatiently.

          LUKE
    ... I told you, I'm not hungry.

          CREATURE
    Patience.  It's time to eat.

          LUKE
    Look, it smells good.  I'm sure
    it's delicious   But I don't
    know why we can't see Yoda now.

          CREATURE
    It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.

          LUKE
    Will it take long to get there?
    How far away is he?

          CREATURE
    Not far, not far.  Be patient.
    Soon you will see him.  Why wish
    you become a Jedi?

          LUKE
    Because of my father, I guess.

          CREATURE
      (placing food on the table)
    Oh, your father ... a powerful
    Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.

          LUKE
      (a little angry)
    How could you know my father?
    You don't even know who I am.
      (fed-up)
    Can't we get on with this already?

  The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a
  third party.

          CREATURE
      (irritated)
    No good is this.  This will not
    do.  I cannot teach him.  The
    boy has no patience!

  Luke's head spins in that direction.  He is startled
  to see the shimmering image of Ben Kenobi.

          LUKE
    Ben!

  Ben is focused on the creature.  They ignore Luke for
  the moment.  The boy is bewildered, but over the next
  few exchanges it dawns on him that the little creature
  is YODA, the Jedi Master.

          BEN
    He will learn patience.

          YODA
    Much anger in him, like in his
    father.

          BEN
    We've discussed this before.

          LUKE
    I can be a Jedi.  I'm ready.

  Yoda sits across the table from Luke.

          YODA
    Ready are you?  What know you of
    ready?  I have trained Jedi for
    800 years.  My own counsel I'll
    keep on who is to be trained.

          LUKE
    Why not me?

          YODA
    To become a Jedi takes the deepest
    commitment, the most serious mind.

          BEN
    He can do it.

          YODA
      (to Ben, indicating Luke)
    This one I have watched a long
    time.  All his life has he looked
    away ... to the horizon, to the
    sky, to the future.  Never his
    mind on where he was, on what he
    was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...
      (turning to Luke)
    A Jedi craves not these things!

  Luke looks down, knows it's true.

          LUKE
    I have followed my feelings.

          YODA
    You are reckless!

          BEN
    He'll learn.

          YODA
    He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to
    start the training.

  Luke thinks he hears a tiny softening.

          LUKE
    But it hasn't been wasted time.
    I've learned much already.

  Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the
  Jedi Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much
  the boy has learned.  After a long moment, the little
  creature turns toward Ben, who meets his look evenly and
  seems almost to nod.

          YODA
    Will he finish what he begins?

          BEN
    We've come this far ... He is our
    only hope.

  Yoda concedes with a resigned look and Ben's image
  fades away.  Yoda continues to stare at the spot for a
  long time.

          LUKE
    I will not fail you.  I'm not
    afraid.

          YODA
      (turns slowly toward him)
    You will be, my young one.  Heh.
    You will be.

  against a vast sea of stars.

294 INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER    294

  The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A
  STRANGE SOUND is heard and light begins to play across
  Vader's black figure.  He looks up and bows quickly.

  A twelve foot hologram of the GALACTIC EMPEROR material-
  izes before Vader.  The Emperor's face cannot be seen,
  for it is shrouded in dark robes with a monk's hood,
  reminiscent of the cloak worn by old Ben Kenobi.  His
  voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader's.

          EMPEROR
    You may rise, my servant.

  Vader rises, but he is afraid of his master and contin-
  ually looks at his feet.

          VADER
    What is thy bidding, My Master?

          EMPEROR
    There is a grave disturbance in
    The Force.

          VADER
    I have felt it.

          EMPEROR
    Our situation is most precarious.
    We have a new enemy who could
    bring about our destruction.

          VADER
    Our destruction?  Who?

          EMPEROR
    The son of Skywalker.  You must
    destroy him ... or he will be
    our undoing.

          VADER
    He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy.
    Obi-wan could not have taught him
    so much that ...

          EMPEROR
    You are weak!  I have seen it.
    The Force is strong with him.
    He must be destroyed.

          VADER
    But, if he could be turned, he
    would be a powerful ally.

          EMPEROR
      (a long pause)
    Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.

          VADER
    He will join us or die, My Master.

  Vader kneels.  The supreme  Emperor passes a hand over
  the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away.

295 EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID CAVE       295

  The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid
  cave.  It is so dark, the exact dimensions are impossible
  to determine.

296 INT COCKPIT - MILLENNIUM FALCON       296

  The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator
  lights on the control panel.  Princess Leia is sitting
  alone in the pilot's seat.  She runs her hand across
  the control panel as she thinks of Han, and the
  confusion he's created within her.

  Something catches her  eye outside the cockpit window.
  With the reflection of the dash lights, it's hard to
  make out what it is.  She moves closer to the glass
  and peers into the gloom.  Suddenly, there are two
  large yellow eyes staring back at her.  Leia is startled
  and jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding.  There
  is a SCURRY of feet and a loud SCREECH, the eyes are
  gone.

  The young Princess catches her breath, jumps out of her
  chair and races from the cockpit.

297 INT MAIN HOLD AREA            297

  The lights go bright for a second, then go out again.
  Threepio turns to Chewbacca who is looking over his
  shoulder at the control panel.  Han finishes with some
  wires.

          THREEPIO
    Everything checks out here.  If
    I might say so, I believe that
    should do it.

  The Wookiee BARKS and turns as Leia rushes into the
  cabin.  Han drops the final floor panel into place.

          LEIA
    There's something out there!

          HAN
    Where?

          LEIA
    Outside, in the cave.

  There's a sharp BANGING on the hull.  Chewie looks up
  and BARKS.

          THREEPIO
    It sounds like it's trying to get
    in.

          HAN
    I'm going to see what it is.

          LEIA
    Are you crazy!

          HAN
    Look, we just got this bucket
    going again.  I'm not about to
    let some varmint tear it apart ...

  He grabs a breath mask off a rack and the Wookiee does
  likewise.  Leia follows.

          LEIA
    If there's more than one, you're
    going to need help.

  Threepio looks around and sees that he's been deserted.

          THREEPIO
    But that leaves me here all alone!

298 EXT MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID CAVE       298

  It is very dark and dank inside the huge asteroid cave.
  Too dark to see what is tearing apart the ship.  Chewie
  BARKS through his face mask, and points over the jutting
  cockpit.  A five foot shape can be seen moving across the
  top of the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a
  screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt.  The black
  shape stumbles, then tumbles off the spaceship and lands
  at the feet of the Princess.  She leans over and studies
  the thing.

          LEIA
    Looks like some kind of Mynock.

          HAN
      (looking around)
    There will be more of them.  They
    always travel in groups.  And
    there's nothing they like better
    than to attach themselves to ships.
    Just what we need right now.

  Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

          LEIA
    This asteroid has the strangest
    consistency ... Look at the ground,
    it's not like rock at all.

  Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to
  study the outline of the cave.  There is a Mynock
  screech in the distance.

          HAN
    There's an awful lot of moisture
    in here.

  Han unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side
  of the huge cave.  Moments later the cavern begins to
  shake and the ground begins to buckle.

          HAN
    I was afraid of that,

  Chew BARKS and starts for the ship. Leia and Han follow
  quickly.

299 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON ENTRY - HOLD AREA     299

  As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the
  main hatch. The ship continues to shake and heave.

          HAN
    Chewie, fire her up!  We're
    getting out of here.

  Threepio and the Wookiee head for the cockpit as Han
  rushes to the control panel in the hold area and checks
  the scopes. Leia follows.

          LEIA
    It's just another tremor the
    Empire is still out there.  I
    don't think it's safe to.

  Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

          HAN
    There's no time to discuss this
    in committee.

  And with that he's gone.  The main engines of the Falcon
  begin to whine.  She races after him, bouncing around in
  the shaking ship.

          LEIA
      (angry)
    I am not a committee!

300 INT COCKPIT - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CAVE      300

  Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the
  throttle.  The earthquake begins to stop. Leia enters.

          LEIA
    Those Star Destroyers will spot us
    long before you can get into light
    speed.  You can't make the jump in
    this asteroid field.

          HAN
    Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're
    taking off!

          LEIA
    But the tremors have stopped.

  The ship begins to move forward, the sides of the cave
  move away.  Chewie barks as he notices something out
  the window ahead.

  Yoda is sitting on a branch high in one of the bog's
  weird trees.  His legs straddle the branch and clasped
  in his webbed feet is Luke's laser sword.  On the
  ground below, Luke sets himself up and jumps toward Yoda.
  He jumps incredibly well for a human, but it doesn't
  bring him close to his object.

  of what must have been quite a marathon.  Yoda
  rides in a pouch on Luke's back.  The young apprentice
  is sweaty and exhausted.  He stumbles into the clearing
  where Artoo has been patiently waiting.  As Luke is
  about to collapse, Yoda throws a small metal bar in
  front of him.  Luke ignites his laser sword and swings
  at it.  He missed and the bar falls to the ground.
  Luke does too.

          LUKE
      (breathless)
    I can't ... Too tired.

          YODA
    It would be in seven pieces,
    were you a Jedi.

  In his mouth is a Gimer Stick, a short twig with
  three little branches at the far end.  Luke is
  nowhere in sight, but now we begin to hear the
  sound of someone crashing through the foliage.
  Suddenly Luke appears on the far side of the pond
  at a run and leaps out toward Yoda.  It's an
  extraordinary leap, but he falls short by six feet,
  creating a huge splash, which drenches Yoda and
  his Gimer Stick.

  Luke.  Slowly, one of the rocks lifts from the
  ground and floats up to rest on the other.  Luke
  smiles with satisfaction and turns to Yoda for

  beeps his review.

  taps Luke's leg.  Luke focusing and quickly removes
  one hand.  His body wavers, but he maintains his

    No!  No different!  The differences
    are in your mind.  Throw them out!
    No longer of use are they to you.

    Size has no meaning.  It matters
    not.  Look at me.  Judge me by
    my size do you?

  Luke shakes his head no.

          YODA
    And well you shouldn't.  For my
    ally is The Force.  And a powerful
    ally it is.  All of life feeds it
    and makes it grow.  Its energy

  A CONTROLLER interrupts.

          CONTROLLER
    Sir, we have a priority signal
    from the Star Destroyer Vengeful.

  The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of
  galactic fortune hunters:  there is BOSSK, a slimy,
  tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a
  soft baggy face;  TUCKUSS and DENGAR, two battle-scarred,
  mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome
  war droid; and BOBA FETT, a man in a weapon-covered
  armored space suit.

    reward for the one who finds the

          CAPTAIN NEEDA
    Then why did they attack?  They
    could have gone into hyperspace
    when they cleared the asteroid
    field.

          TRACKING OFFICER
    Well, there's no trace of them,
    sir, no matter how they did it.
    The only logical explanation is
    that they went into lightspeed ....

          DECK OFFICER
    Sir, Lord Vader demands an update
    on the pursuit .... What should
    he be told?

  The captain looks at his aide with a resigned expression.

          CAPTAIN NEEDA
    I am responsible for this.  Get
    the shuttle ready.  When we rendezvous
    with Lord Vader, I will apologize to
    him myself ... Turn around and
    scan the area one more time.

332 EXT SWAMP - BOG - DUSK            332

  Luke lies motionless in the mud with Artoo leaning
  over him.  Two glowing balls about the size of base-
  balls hover above them like mosquitoes and occasionally
  the angry Artoo swats at them; they move just out of
  the stubby droid's reach.  Artoo whistles to his master
  several times, but gets no response.  Artoo turns toward
  Yoda, who is sitting quietly nearby chewing on his Gimer
  Stick, and begins to furiously beep and scold the little
  Jedi Master.

  Artoo turns back to Luke.  A small metal electrode
  projects out of Artoo and rests on Luke's chest.
  There is a concerned whistle from the droid, a short
  electronic yap, and Luke jumps awake with a start.  The
  young Jedi shakes his head clear and rubs his shoulder.
  He is very angry; his glare moves between Yoda and the
  two glowing balls.

          YODA
      (jovial)
    Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.

          LUKE
      (pissed)
    I thought those seekers were set
    for stun!

          YODA
    That they are.

          LUKE
    They're a lot stronger than I'm
    used to.

          YODA
    That would matter not were The
    Force flowing through you.  Higher
    you'd jump!  Faster you'd move!
    Open yourself to The Force you must.

  Artoo scoots away as the fed-up Luke grabs his laser
  sword from the mud, ignites it and jumps up.

          LUKE
    I'm open to it now!  I feel it.
    Come on you little flying blasters!

  As he moves toward the hovering balls with a poised
  saber and ferocious look, they draw away, retreating
  to the area around Yoda's head.

          YODA
    No, no.  This will not do.  Anger
    is what you feel.

          LUKE
    But I feel The Force flowing!

          YODA
    Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark
    side of The Force are they.  Easily
    they flow ... quick to join you in
    a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of
    them.  A heavy price is paid for the
    power they bring.

  Luke lowers his light saber, confused.

          LUKE
    Price?  What do you mean?

          YODA
    The dark side beckons.  But if
    once start down the dark path,
    forever will it dominate your
    destiny.  Consume you it will ...
    as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.

          LUKE
    Lord Vader ... Is the dark side
    stronger?

          YODA
    No, no.  Easier, quicker, more
    seductive.

          LUKE
    But how am I to know the good
    side from the dark?

          YODA
    You will know.  When you are at
    peace ... calm ... passive.  A
    Jedi uses The Force for knowledge
    and defense.  Never for attack.

          LUKE
    But tell me why ...

          YODA
    No!  Nothing more will I tell you
    now. Clear your mind of questions
    ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...

  Luke stops protesting, relaxes his body.

          YODA
    ... Yes ... calm ...

  Luke closes his eyes, tries to clear his thoughts.

          YODA
      (soothing)
    ... passive ... Let yourself go ...

  After a long moment, Yoda makes the tiniest little
  gesture and the two glowing balls near his head race
  toward Luke, firing stun bolts.  Luke immediately
  springs to life, but in a lovely, graceful way.  He
  moves incredibly fast, deflecting bolts thrown at him
  from all directions, jumping incredibly high.

  The seeker attack stops as suddenly as it started and
  the two balls retreat to either side of Yoda's head.
  Artoo lets out a sigh and shakes his head.  Luke grins
  proudly at Yoda who continues to chew away.

          YODA
    Much progress do you make, young
    one.  Stronger do you grow.

  Luke is bursting with his achievement as two more
  glowing seekers float into view from behind Yoda's
  back, making a poised line of four above Yoda.  Luke's
  grin melts away.

  it quickly away as Admiral Piett and two of his captains
  hurry up to the Dark Lord.

          ADMIRAL PIETT
    Lord Vader, our ships have completed
    their scan of the area and found
    nothing.  The Millennium Falcon
    definitely went into lightspeed.
    It's probably on the other side
    of the galaxy by now.

          VADER

    possible destination along their
    last known trajectory and disburse
    the fleet to search for them.  Don't
    fail me again, Admiral, I've had
    quite enough!

          ADMIRAL PIETT
    Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.

  Everyone is hanging in their chairs sideways.  Threepio
  is shut down.  Leia glances at him.

          LEIA
    You could have warned him before
    you shut him off.

          HAN
    Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to
    offend your droid.  You think
    braking and shutting down in
    that amount of time is easy?

          LEIA
    I'm still not sure what you've
    accomplished.

          HAN

    on the landing claws.

  Chewie BARKS, struggles from his seat, and climbs out
  of the cabin.

          LEIA
    What'd you have in mind for your
    next move?

          HAN
      (pointing out window)
    The fleet is finally breaking up.
    I'm hoping they'll follow standard
    Imperial procedure and dump their
    garbage before they go into light
    speed.

  Leia gets it after a moment.  She smiles and pats Han
  like a puppy.

          LEIA
    Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then
    what?

          HAN
    Then we have to find a safe port
    around here.  Got any ideas?

          LEIA
    That depends.  Where are we?

          HAN
    Here ... near the Anoat system.

  Han points to a configuration of small light points
  on a computer map screen on the control panel.  Leia
  slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome
  pilot.  Several systems flash by on the computer screen.

          HAN
    Funny, I have the feeling I've
    been in this area before.  Let
    me check my logs.

          LEIA
    You keep logs?  My, how organized.

          HAN
    Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I
    knew it!  Lando Calrissian.

          LEIA
    Never heard of that system.

          HAN
    Lando's not a system, he's a man.
    A gambler, con-artist ... all-
    around scoundrel ...
      (winks at Leia)
    ... your kind of guy.  The system
    is called Bespin.  It's a ways
    from here, but reachable.

          HAN
    A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it
    in a sabacc match, or so he claims.
    Lando and I go way back.

          LEIA
    Can you trust him?

          HAN
    No.  But he has no love for the
    Empire, that much I know ...

  Chewie BARKS something on the intercom.  Han quickly
  changes his readouts and stretches to look out the
  cockpit window.

          HAN
    I see it, Chewie, I see it ...
    Prepare the manual release.
      (turns to Leia)
    Here goes nothing, sweetheart.

  Han leans back in his chair and gives her an inviting
  smile.  She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin
  creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss.

          LEIA
    You do have your moments ... Not
    many, but you do have them.

          HAN
    Let Ôer go, Chewie.

340 EXT BOG TRAIL - DUSK            340

  Luke runs through the Bog, jumping incredibly high
  over roots, doing amazing double flips across mud holes,
  racing in and out of the heavy ground fog.  Yoda again
  rides on Luke's neck.

  Yoda tosses a silver bar high above Luke, but behind
  him.  The young warrior instantly turns and cuts the
  bar into four pieces.  Yoda is pleased, but Luke is
  suddenly distracted, wary.

          YODA
    Four this time!  The Force you
    feel.

          LUKE
    Yes ... I also feel danger ...
    death.  Something's not right.

  Luke turns to see a huge, tangled, dead black tree.
  It's base is surrounded by a few feet of water.  Giant,
  twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave near one
  side.  Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.  He stares
  at the tree, breathing hard.

          LUKE
    You brought me here purposely.

  Yoda sits on a large root, pulls out his chew stick.

          LUKE
    I feel cold.

          YODA
    This tree is strong with the dark
    side of The Force.  A servant of
    evil it is.  Into it you must go.

          LUKE
    What's in there?

          YODA
    Only what you take with you.

  Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He ignites
  his light saber and steps into the water.

          YODA
    Your weapon ... you won't need it.

  Luke gives the tree a long look, then shakes his head
  Òno.Ó  Yoda shrugs.  Luke wades across the water and
  steps into the darkness of the cave.

341 INT TREE CAVE - DAGOBAH         341

  Luke moves into almost total darkness.  It's wet and
  slimy.  The young Jedi can barely make out the edge of
  the passage.  Suddenly, he is enveloped by a thick
  spider web-like membrane.  He thrashes to clear himself
  and cuts through it with his laser sword.  When he is
  free of it, he holds the saber out before him.  Five
  inches from his face, a beetle the size of Luke's hand
  scurries up the wall to join its mates.  Luke draws
  back only a moment, then pushes deeper into the cave.

  The space widens around him, but he can feel that rather
  than see it. His sword casts the only light.  Luke
  peers into the darkness.  It has become very quiet here.
  There is a long, long beat.

  A loud HISS!  Darth Vader appears across the blackness,
  illuminated by his just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately,
  he charges Luke, saber before him.  He is upon him in
  seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at
  Vader with his sword.

  Vader is decapitated.  His head and helmet fly from his
  shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness.
  The metallic BANGING of the helmet fills the cave as
  Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor
  and stops.  For one instant it sits whole on the floor.
  Then it cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath
  mask fall away to reveal ... Luke's head.

  Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight,
  wide-eyed in terror.

  The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

  they march across the narrow bridge leading to the
  landing platform.

    It'll be all right.  Trust me.
      (pause)
    And keep your eyes open.  You
    wait here.

  Han walks down the ramp, followed by Chewie.  Lando
  has a pleased, proprietory look on his face as he
  gazes at the ship, which fades to a neutral look as
  he stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each
  other carefully.  Lando just shakes his head.

          LANDO
    Why you slimy, double-crossing
    no-good swindler ... am I glad
    to see you.

          HAN

    wasting your time with this clown,
    eh?

          CHEWIE
    Growls a reserved greeting.

          LANDO
      (not understanding)
    Right.

  Leia starts down the ramp, followed by Threepio.
  Lando glances up at her and does a slow take.

          LANDO
    Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome,
    I am Baron Lando Calrissian,
    Administrator of this facility ...
    and who might you be?

          LEIA

  Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

    relations, at your ...

  Before Threepio can finish his introduction, Han has
  put his arm around Lando and steered away from Leia,
  back toward the city.

          HAN
    She's traveling with me, Lando
    and I don't intend to gamble her
    away, so you might as well forget
    she exists.

  Lando glances longingly over his shoulder at Leia who
  is following behind the two old friends.

          LANDO
    That won't be easy, my friend ...
    What brings you here, anyway?

          HAN
    Repairs ...

          LANDO
      (mock panic)
    What have you done to my ship?

  Han smiles, explains over his shoulder to Leia.

          HAN
    Lando used to own the Falcon.  And
    he sometimes forgets that he lost
    it fair and square.

  Lando concedes this with a little gesture, speaks to
  Leia.

          LANDO
    That ship saved my life a few
    times.  It's the fastest hunk of
    machinery in the galaxy.

  rounding several corners and passing many small plazas
  as they go.  Threepio legs a bit behind.

          HAN
    How's your mining operation going?

          LANDO
    Not as well as I'd like.  We're
    a small outpost and not very self-
    sufficient.  I've had supply
    problems of every kind and ...
      (catches Han grinning at him)
    What's so funny?

          HAN
    Nothing.  I never would have
    guessed that underneath that
    wild schemer I knew was a respon-
    sible leader and businessman ...
    But you wear it well.

  Lando is reflective, he looks at Han a moment.

          LANDO
    Seeing you sure brings back a
    few things ...
      (shakes his head)
    Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
    It's the price of success.  And
    you know what, Han, you were
    right all along.  It's over-rated.

  Han and Lando laugh together.  As the lagging Threepio
  passes a doorway, he hears the muffled beeping and
  whistling of an R-2 unit.

  Threepio enters the off-shoot corridor.

    forgotten what they sound like ...

  As Threepio is about to reach another doorway, the door
  to the main passage closes behind him.  He looks into
  the room.

          THREEPIO

  A laserbolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in
  twenty directions.  Smoldering mechanical arms and
  legs bounce off the walls.

  sets, then jumps.  This time he not only grabs the
  sword but soars an extra couple feet, high enough to
  flash a quick grin at Yoda, eye to eye.

358 EXT YODA'S BOG (MONTAGE)        358

  Luke is standing on one hand again, with Yoda perched
  up on his feet.  But now Luke's face shows less strain,

  fingers off the ground.  He is balancing on his thumb.

  off into the watery swamp.  Luke and Yoda are sitting
  in the camp facing each other.  The young warrior's
  eyes are closed.

          YODA
    Be calm.  Through The Force, things
    you will see: other places, other
    thoughts, the future, the past,
    old friends long gone.

    fast.

          LUKE
    I see a city in the clouds.

          YODA
    Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends
    you have there, heh?  Concentrate
    and see them you will.

          LUKE
    I see them! ... They're in pain ...
    they're suffering.

          YODA
    It is the future you see.

  As Luke moans, Artoo stops his work and rushes over to
  his master and starts beeping angrily at Yoda, crowding
  him.

          LUKE
    Will they die?

          YODA
    Difficult to see.  Always in
    motion is the future ... Back
    away, little machine!

  Yoda lifts his hand towards the pushing droid and
  Artoo lets out a quick shriek of shock and moves away,
  mumbling and looking back at Yoda.  Luke has started
  to gather up his things.

          LUKE
    They're my friends.

          YODA
    Foreknowledge is helpful, but
    painful sometimes and dangerous
    too.  You have far to go in your
    training.

  Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds
  him as he plops down and Artoo comes over to comfort
  him.

359X  INT JUNK ROOM - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN       359X

  A room piled high with broken or discarded parts.
  Chewie is poking around ... seems to find a piece that
  pleases him ... tosses another part away.  Moves around
  a large piece, which partially obscures him - he lets
  out a savage growl at what he sees.

360 INT LIVING QUARTERS - CLOUD CITY - DAY - BESPIN   360

  Sunlight pours through the skylight in a large art-deco
  living area onto which four apartments open.  Han
  slouches in a lounge chair with his feet on a table.
  He aims his blaster at a glow globe and makes a firing
  sound with his tongue.  He turns to see Leia standing
  in the doorway to her apartment.

  Han is knocked out by the sight.  He holsters his
  blaster distractedly as he ogles the radiant Leia.  She
  has changed from her cold weather pants and jacket to a
  lovely dress.  Her hair is up, tied with ribbons.

          LEIA
    What are you staring at?

          HAN
      (ga-ga)
    Who's staring?

          LEIA
    You look silly.

          HAN
    You look great.

          LEIA
      (embarrassed)
    Has Threepio turned up yet?

          HAN
    Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone
    too long just to be lost.  He may
    have gotten into some trouble.
    Chewie went to look for him.
      (he pats a spot on his lounge)
    Come over here.  I want to check
    this out.

  Leia thinks it over a moment, then walks over and
  settles next to Han, who's overjoyed with her apparent
  pliancy.  he's about to envelop her when she throws on
  the ice water ...

          LEIA
    I hope Luke made it to the fleet
    all right.

          HAN
    Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably
    sitting around wondering what we're
    doing right now.

  Han puts his arm around her.  They are ready to kiss.
  The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in carrying a
  packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging
  over the edge.  He drops the box on the table.

          CHEWIE
    Barks at his master.

          LEIA
    What happened?

          HAN
    He found him in a junk pile ...

          LEIA
    Something's wrong here.  Your
    friend Lando is very charming,
    but I don't trust him.

          HAN
    Well, I do trust him.  Lando's
    an old friend.  Must have been
    an accident.

          LEIA
    Chewie, do you think you can repair
    him?

  The giant Wookiee has been studying the array of robot
  parts.  He looks at the Princess.

          CHEWIE
    Howls and shrugs his shoulders.

          HAN
    Why don't we just turn him over
    to Lando to fix?

          LEIA
    No thanks.

          HAN
    Look, sweetheart, I'm not going
    to have you accusing my friend of ...

  There is a BUZZ and the door slides open revealing
  Lando and a pair of body guards.

          LANDO
    Sorry, am I interrupting anything?

          LEIA
    Not really.

          LANDO
    I must say, your beauty is unpar-
    alleled.  Truly you belong here
    with us among the clouds.

          LEIA
      (icy)
    Thanks.

          LANDO
    Would you care to join me for a
    little refreshment?

  Han looks at Lando suspiciously.

          CHEWIE
    Barks at the mention of food.
    Licks his lips.

          LANDO
    Everyone's invited, of course.

  Leia takes Lando's proffered arm and the group turns
  to go.  Lando spots Threepio's remains.

          LANDO
    Having problems with you droid?

  Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

          HAN
    An accident.  Nothing we can't
    handle.

  The door slides closed behind them, leaving the battered
  droid on the table.

361 INT CORRIDOR - CLOUD CITY - DAY       361

  Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie and the two
  bodyguards follow a short distance behind.  Long shafts
  of light pour across the corridor between tall columns.

          LANDO
    .... We are a free station and do
    not fall under the jurisdiction
    of the Empire.

          LEIA
    You're part of the mining guild
    then?

          LANDO
    Not actually .... Our operation
    is small enough not to be noticed,
    so you might say we're enterprisers.
    Most of our trade is, well ...
    unofficial.

362 EXT VERANDA - CLOUD CITY - DAY          362

  The corridor opens onto a veranda which overlooks the
  spiraled top of the city.

  City Plaza - as Lando and group pass.  City in back-
  ground with several cloud cars flying around.

          LEIA
    It's a lovely outpost.

          LANDO
    Yes, we keep pollution down by
    having the power reactor far below
    the city.  It's connected by a
    transfer shaft.

363 INT CORRIDOR - CLOUD CITY - DAY       363

  They re-enter the corridor and head for a huge doorway
  at the far end.  Chewie begins to sniff something.

          CHEWIE
    Barks at Han.

          HAN
    Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't
    you afraid the Empire might
    discover this little operation
    and shut you down?

          LANDO
    That's always been the danger.
    It's loomed like a shadow over
    everything we've built here.  But
    circumstances have developed
    which will insure security.  You
    see, I've just made a deal that
    will keep the Empire out of here
    forever ...

364 INT DINING ROOM - CLOUD CITY - DAY      364

  The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and
  the group enters the elegant room.  At the far end of
  a huge banquet table sits, Darth Vader.  At his side
  and slightly behind him is standing Boba Fett, the
  bounty hunter.  Han gives Lando a mean look.

          LANDO
    Sorry friend, I had no choice.
    They arrived right before you
    did.

          HAN
    I'm sorry too.

  Faster than the wink of an eye, Han has drawn his
  blaster and popped off a couple of quick shots directly
  at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his hand,
  deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where
  they explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon
  zips out of his grip and mysteriously flies across the
  room into Vader's hand.  The evil presence calmly places
  the gun on the table in front of him.

          VADER
    I'm glad you could join us.  have
    some nourishment, for it will
    be your last meal.

365 EXT YODA'S BOG (MONTAGE) - DAGOBAH      365

  In the bog clearing, Yoda watches as Luke stares at two
  equipment cases from the supplies of his fighter.
  Artoo watches from nearby.  Now the two cases lift into
  the air and exchange places.  Luke smiles to himself
  feeling strong and playful.  Now he lifts the two
  equipment cases again, plus a bewildered, beeping Artoo,
  who is roughly the same size.

366 EXT YODA'S HOUSE (MONTAGE) - DAGOBAH      366

  Luke is squatting before Yoda's little stove, working
  over a chaos of steaming pots, chopping, stirring and
  sprinkling in a manner strongly reminiscent of Yoda,
  who, by the way, is not around.  Suddenly a painful
  vision fills Luke's mind; he winces and stops his
  cooking for a few moments.  It passes away, Luke shakes
  it off and goes back to his cooking.  After a few long
  beats, behind Luke's back and unseen by him, three of
  Yoda's glowing-ball seekers float quietly into view.
  They pause, then race toward Luke firing stun bolts.
  The young Jedi instantly twists to face them, deflect-
  ing all the bolts with the pot lid in his left hand and
  the spoon in his right.

367 EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DUSK - DAGOBAH       367

  It is almost dark ... in the woods a tiny light moves
  towards us ... finally we see it is Artoo ... he stops
  within sight of Yoda's house.  A warm light pours out
  of the house illuminating Luke who is asleep on the
  ground.  A blanket lies half-off Luke; Artoo carefully
  pulls it up to fully cover Luke.  As Artoo moves away
  Luke begins reacting to a nightmare.  He moans ...
  opens his eyes wide and sits up.  Yoda comes to the
  doorway and looks out.

          LUKE
      (to Yoda)
    I can't keep the vision out of
    my head ... My friends ... they're
    in trouble ... I feel that ...

  Suddenly the shimmering image of Ben Kenobi appears
  before Luke.

          BEN
    ... Luke, you must not go.

          LUKE
    But Han and Leia will surely die.

          BEN
    You don't know that.  Even I
    cannot see their fate.

          LUKE
    I can help them!

          BEN
    You're not ready yet.  You still
    have much to learn.

          LUKE
    I feel The Force.

          BEN
    But you cannot control it.  This
    is a dangerous time for you, Luke.
    You are now most susceptible to
    the temptations of the dark side.

          YODA
    Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen
    young one.  The tree.  Remember
    your failure at the tree!  Heh?

          LUKE
    I've learned so much since then.  And
    I'll return to finish ... I promise
    that, master.

          BEN
    Will you?  You underestimate The
    Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that
    is why your friends suffer.

          LUKE
    And that is why I must go.

          BEN
    Luke, I will not lose you to the
    Emperor, as I lost Vader.

          LUKE
    You won't.

          BEN
    Only a fully trained Jedi Knight,
    with The Force as his ally, will
    conquer Vader and his Emperor.
    If you end your training now, if
    you choose the quick and easy path
    ... as Vader did ... you will
    become an agent of evil ... and
    the galaxy will be plunged deeper
    into the abyss of hate, despair
    and pain that you feel your friends
    suffering now.

          YODA
    Stopped they must be.  Do you
    hear?  On this all depends.

          BEN
    You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You
    are our only hope.  Be patient.

          LUKE
    And sacrifice Han and Leia?

          YODA
    If it must be.  Yes.

  Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the
  dilemma, a battle raging in his head.  But then
  there is a clearing in his expression, a choice
  made.

          LUKE
    I cannot.  Ben, I must go.  Now
    that I can see their suffering,
    I must help ...

  Luke looks for a long moment at Ben and Yoda.  Then
  he turns and starts toward his ship followed by his
  faithful droid.  Yoda looks at Ben with a certain
  irritation, but Ben is focusing on Luke.  The old
  man's expression is resigned.

367X  EXT X WING FIGHTER - EDGE OF WATER - DUSK - DAGOBAH 367X

  The fighter's lights come on.  Luke is in the process
  of hoisting a heavy case into the belly of the ship by
  a cable.  Artoo is on top of the ship settling down
  into his place.  Luke stops what he is doing as Ben
  appears.  Yoda steps into the light.

          BEN
    I cannot protect you, Luke.  If
    you choose to face Vader, you
    will do it alone.  Once you've
    made this decision, I cannot
    interfere.

  Artoo unfastens power couplings on the ship.

          LUKE
    I understand.
      (to Yoda)
    I'll be back, Master Yoda.  I
    will finish what I have begun
    I give you my word.  Artoo, fire
    up the power converters.

          ARTOO
    Whistles a happy reply.

          BEN
    Luke, use The Force only for
    knowledge and for defense, not
    as a weapon.  Don't give in to
    hate or anger or fear ... they
    lead the way to the dark side ...
  Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.

          YODA
    Strong is Vader.  Clouded is
    your fate.  Mind what you have
    learned ... Notice everything,
    everything!  It can save you.

          LUKE
    I will, master, I will!

  Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching
  as the roar of the engines and the wind engulfs them.

          YODA
    Told you, I did.  Reckless is he
    ... Now things are going to worse.

          BEN
    The boy is our last hope.

          YODA
    No ... there is another.

370 INT LARGE CELL - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN      370

  Chewie, huffing and puffing, paces the cell in anger.
  He puts his ear to the wall, hears nothing and goes
  back to an area where there are four beds.  A dis-
  assembled Threepio rests on one of the beds.  The
  Wookiee picks up the golden droid's head and meditates
  on it a few moments.

          CHEWIE
    Barks a few remarks of a philoso-
    phical nature.

  Chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts
  adjusting wires and circuits.  Suddenly, the lights in
  Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches two
  connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to
  speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be
  unintelligible.

          THREEPIO
    Immmm-peer-eee-alll-storrr-mmmm-
    trooo ...

  Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches
  his furry head, gets and idea and adjusts some connections.
  Threepio immediately begins speaking normally.

          THREEPIO
    Stormtroopers!  Help!  Oh, my
    head ... Where am I?

  Chewie barks with glee at the robot's return to life.

          THREEPIO
    Chewbacca!  Watch out, there are
    Imperial Stormtroopers hidden in
    ... Oh no, I've been shot!

371 INT PRISON AREA - CLOUD CITY        371

  The door to another cell slides open and the muffled
  yells of Han Solo become sharp, piercing screams of
  agony and pain.  Darth Vader exits the cell and is
  approached by Lando, Lando's aide, and Boba Fett.

          VADER
    Bounty hunter, if you are waiting
    for your reward, you will wait
    until I have Skywalker.

          BOBA
      (a very tough customer)
    I am in no hurry, Lord Vader.  My
    concern is that Captain Solo not
    be damaged.  The reward from
    Jabba the Hutt pays double if
    he's alive.

          VADER
    His pain is considerable, bounty
    hunter, but he will not be harmed.

          LANDO
    What about Leia and the Wookiee?

          VADER
    You will find them well enough.
    But they must never again leave
    this city.

          LANDO
    That was never mentioned.  Neither
    was this bounty hunter taking Han.
    I hope you haven't forgotten our
    bargain.

          VADER
    I forget nothing, Calrissian.
    Perhaps you think you're being
    treated unfairly.

          LANDO
      (glances at his aide)
    No.

          VADER
    Good.  It would be most unfortunate
    if I had to leave a permanent
    garrison here.

  Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.
  Lando turns with his aide and walks swiftly down another
  corridor.

          LANDO
    This deal's getting worse all
    the time.

          AIDE
    Maybe you should have argued with
    him.

  Lando gives his aide a look that speaks volumes, then
  walks a few steps in silence, thinking.

          LANDO
      (finally)
    I've got a bad feeling about this.

372 INT LARGE CELL              372

  Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.
  One arm is connected, but his legs have yet to be
  attached.  There is one small problem, however; it
  appears the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's
  head on backwards.

          THREEPIO
    Well, something's not right because
    now I can't see.
      (Chewie barks and
        adjusts a wire)
    There now, that's better, wait ...
    Oh, my.  What have you done?  I'm
    backwards!  You flea-bitten furball!
    Only an overgrown mophead like you
    would be stupid enough to put my
    head ...

  Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie deactivates
  a circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells
  something and sits up.  The door to the chamber slides
  open and a ragged Han Solo is helped into the room by
  two Stormtroopers.  The huge Wookiee gives him a
  hug as the Stormtroopers leave.  Han is very pale,
  with dark circles under his eyes.

          CHEWIE
    Barks his concern.

          HAN
    No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.

  Chewie BARKS again as the door slides open revealing
  Leia.  She looks a little worse for war also.  The
  troopers shove her into the cell, and the door slides
  closed.  Chewie helps her up and over to Han.  The
  two lovers embrace, kiss.

          HAN
    I was worried about you.

          LEIA
    I'm worried about all of us.  I
    can't figure out what they're up
    to.

          HAN
    Me either.  They had me howling
    on the scan grid, but they never
    asked me any questions.

  The cell door slides open.  Lando and two Bespin troops
  enter.

          HAN
    Get out of here, Lando!

          LANDO
    Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm
    doing what I can to make this
    easier for you.

          HAN
    This ought to be good.

          LANDO
    Vader agreed to turn Leia and
    Chewie over to me.  They'll have
    to stay here, but at least they'll
    be safe.

          LEIA
    What about Han?

          LANDO
      (to Han)
    I didn't know you had a price on
    your head.  Vader has given you
    to the bounty hunter.

  Leia looks with concern to Han.

          HAN
    You don't know much about much if
    you think Vader won't want us dead
    before this is over.

          LANDO
    He doesn't want you at all.  He's
    after someone named Skywalker.

          HAN
    Luke?  I don't get it.

  Leia's mind is racing.

          LANDO
    Lord Vader has set a trap for
    him and ...

          LEIA
    ... we're the bait.

          HAN
    All this just to get the kid?
    What's so important about him?

          LANDO
    Don't ask me, but he's on his
    way.

          LEIA
    Luke's coming here?

  Lando nods.  Han's rage peaks.

          HAN
    You fixed us all pretty good ...
      (spits it out)
    ... friend!

  Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are
  instantly engaged in a frantic close quarters fight.
  The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies
  across the room.  Chewie GROWLS and starts for the
  guards.  They point their laser weapons at the Giant
  Wookiee, but Lando stops them.

          LANDO
    Don't shoot!  I've done what I
    can for you.  I'm sorry it's not
    better, but I've got my own
    problems.
      (turns to leave)
    I've already stuck my neck out
    further than I should ...

          HAN
    Yeah, you're a real hero.

  Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from
  his chin as Leia and Chewie help him onto one of the
  bunks.

          LEIA
      (dabs at his wound)
    You certainly have a way with people.

  Armor-suited Stormtroopers rush about the large chamber,

  middle of the room is a square pit housing a hydraulic
  platform.  Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform.

          VADER
    The facility is crude, but it
    should suit our needs.

  An Aide appears.

          AIDE

          VADER
    Good.  Monitor Skywalker's

    We'll have the chamber ready
    for him shortly.

          LANDO
    We only use this chamber for
    carbon freezing.  If you put him
    in there, it'll kill him.

          ARTOO
    Beeps a ÒnegativeÓ which prints

379 INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN 379

  With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of Stormtroopers
  bring in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to Chewie's
  back, with only his head, torso and one arm assembled
  is Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite
  direction from Chewie's and the droid is constantly
  twisting around in a vain effort to see what's
  happening.  His one attached arm is animate and
  expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing and
  covering his eyes.  The remaining pieces of his body
  are roughly bundled
    to the Wookiee's back.  His legs and other arm
  stick out at odd angles from the pack.

  Vader turns to Boba Fett.

          VADER
    I'll make your goods easier for
    you to transport.  Put Captain
    Solo in the zero-cold chamber.

          BOBA
    But the chamber is for power
    goods.  What if he doesn't survive?
    This slime is worth a lot to me ...

          VADER
    The Empire will pay for the loss.
    Bring him forward!

          LEIA
    No!

  Chewie lets out a wild HOWL and attacks the Stormtroopers
  surrounding Han.  Within seconds many Imperial reinforce-
  ments have joined the scuffle.  The giant Wookiee is
  clubbed with laser weapons.  From the instant of Chewie's
  first move, Threepio is screaming in panic while he tries
  to protect himself with his one arm ...

          THREEPIO
    Wait!  What are you doing? ...
    Oh, no ... Don't hit me!  No!  He
    doesn't mean it! ... Calm down,
    you hairy fool! ... Ouch!  I
    didn't do anything ...

  The Stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

          HAN
    Chewie, no!  Stop it, Chewbacca!

  Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the
  guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

          THREEPIO
    Oh, yes ... stop, stop.  Thank
    heavens ...

  Han gives the Wookiee a stern look, then a big hug.

          HAN
    Save your strength for another
    time, Chewie, when the odds are
    better.

  Han winks at the Wookiee.

          CHEWIE
    Barks a doleful farewell.

          HAN
    I'm sure I'll see you again, too.
    Keep well.
      (turns to guard)
    You'd better chain him until it's
    over.

  In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca,
  who is too distraught to protest.  Han gives his furry
  friend a final hug and turns to Princess Leia.  He takes
  her in his arms and she gives him a passionate kiss.

          LEIA
    ... I love you.  I couldn't tell
    you before, but it's true.

          HAN
    ... just remember that, Ôcause
    I'll be back ...

  He sheds his cocky smile and gives her a soft kiss on
  the forehead.  Tears roll down Leia's face as she
  watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform.
  Lando, too, watches with anguish.

  Imperial guards position Han on the platform and quickly
  bind his arms and legs.  They step back.  Han looks one
  final time at his friends and suddenly the platform
  drops.  Han disappears into the steaming vat of sub-zero
  cold.  Chewie HOWLS.  Leia turns away in agony.  Lando
  winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression
  on him.

  Instantly, a ladle of fiery liquid moves over the vat,
  tilts and pours, creating a shower of sparks and fluid
  as great as any steel furnace.  Chewie has half turned
  away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the
  procedure.

          THREEPIO
    They're encasing him in carbonite.
    It's high quality alloy.  Much
    better than my own.  He should
    be quite well protected ... if
    he survived the freezing process.

  Chewie is in no mood for technical discussions; he
  gives the droid an angry glance.

  A huge mechanical tong lifts the metal encased space
  pirate out of the vat and places him before Vader, Boba
  Fett and Lando.  Technicians inspect the metal mummy
  with various electronic probes, drilling holes and
  attaching hoses.

          TECHNICIAN
    He's alive and in perfect hibernation.

          VADER
    He's all yours, bounty hunter.
    Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

          AIDE
    He's just landed, My Lord.

          VADER
    See to it that he finds his way
    here.

          LANDO
    I'll take what's mine now.

          VADER
    Take them, but I'm keeping a
    detachment of troops here to
    watch over them.

          LANDO
    That wasn't the bargain.  You
    said the Empire wouldn't interfere
    in--

          VADER
    I'm altering the bargain.  Pray
    I don't alter it any further.

  Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he
  turns back to Leia, Chewie and Threepio.

380 INT CORRIDOR - CLOUD CITY         380

  Luke and Artoo move carefully down the deserted corridor.
  Luke stops as he hears a group of people coming down a
  side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited series of beeps
  and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops
  in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

  Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two
  guards carrying the encased body of Han Solo and two
  Stormtroopers, who immediately start firing on the
  young warrior.  Luke draws his weapon and blasts the
  two stormtroopers before they can get off a second shot.
  The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Boba
  lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which
  explodes to one side.

381 INT SIDE HALLWAY - CLOUD CITY - DAY       381

  By the time Luke reaches the side hallway, Boba, Han
  and the guards are gone.  A thick metal door blocks
  the passage.  Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio,
  and Lando being herded away by several other Storm-
  troopers down a second hallway.

          LUKE
    Leia!

          LEIA
    Luke, no!  It's a trap.

  Before she can finish, the group turns a corner and
  is gone.  Luke races after them, leaving little Artoo
  trailing behind.

382 INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN 382

  Luke runs into the zero-cold chamber and stops for a
  second to get his bearings.  Leia and the others are
  nowhere in sight.  Behind Luke, Artoo is whistling
  down the corridor to the chamber when a giant metal
  door comes slamming down with a loud CLANG (seemingly
  on top of the stubby droid), cutting off Luke's exit.
  Several more doors CLANG shut, echoing through the
  chamber.

383 INT HALLWAY LEADING TO CHAMBER - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN  383

  Artoo is standing with his nose up against the giant
  metal door.  He whistles a long sigh of relief and,
  a little dazed, wanders off in the other direction.

384 INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN 384

  Luke searches the complex chamber for any sign of an
  enemy.  There is nothing.  He walks forward toward the
  hydraulic platform, then stops, holstering his gun.

          LUKE
    I know you're with me, Lord Vader,
    I can feel your presence.  Show
    yourself, or do you fear me?

  Vader steps into view behind Luke.  the young Jedi
  turns instantly to face his opponent.

          VADER
    The Force is with you young Skywalker,
    but you are not a Jedi yet.

385 INT CORRIDOR - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN - DAY      385

  Leia, Lando, Chewie and Threepio march along between
  four Stormtroopers.  They reach an intersection where
  a dozen of Lando's guards are standing at attention.
  Lando stops before the sergeant of the guard.

          LANDO
    Code force seven.

  The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled
  Stormtroopers.  The sergeant takes the Stormtroopers
  weapons from them, handing one to Lando, the others to
  Chewie and Leia.  They release Chewie's binders.

          LANDO
    Hold them in the north tower.
    Quietly!  No one must know.

  Lando's guards march the Stormtroopers away.

          LEIA
    What's going on?

          LANDO
    I'm coming over to your side,
    that's what.  And I have a feeling
    I'm making a big mistake.

          LEIA
    And when do you betray us again?

  Lando has to take another look at this broad.  She
  doesn't seem very appreciative.

          LANDO
    Look, I stand to lose everything
    by this.

          LEIA
    We have no use for your kind.

          LANDO
    This is no time to be choosy,
    honey.  What do you say we debate
    this later?  There's still a
    chance I can get you out of here.

          CHEWIE
    Barks a blue streak.

          LANDO
    What's wrong with him?

          THREEPIO
      (Very worried)
    Oh my.  Oh no.  He's not interested
    in escape.  He wants to go after
    Captain Solo .... Artoo!!

  In the distance, down a long hallway in the direction
  that Threepio is facing, a familiar whistling can be
  heard.  Artoo appears and zips up toward the group.
  Chewie turns to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio
  to be spun away from his little friend.

          THREEPIO
    Wait!  Where'd he go?  Turn
    around, you woolly ... Ah, Artoo!

  Artoo has managed to get under Threepio.

          ARTOO
    Beeps a wild series of exclamations
    about his friend's condition.

          THREEPIO
    Don't ask.

          LEIA
    Chewie's right.  We must try to
    save Han.

          LANDO
      (thinking fast)
    There's not much chance, but the
    bounty hunter's ship is on the
    East Landing Platform.

  Lando leads the others quickly down a hall.

          ARTOO
    Beeps wildly.

          THREEPIO
    I'm afraid Lord Vader has Master
    Luke.  There's no hope of saving
    him.

386 INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - CLOUD CITY - BESPIN 386

  Vader ignites his powerful light saber.  Luke takes a
  step back and one foot rests on the cold chamber plat-
  form.  He lights his laser sword and sets himself to
  face the Dark Lord.

          VADER
    The fear does not reach you.  You
    have learned more than I anticipated.

          LUKE
    You'll find I'm full of surprises.

          VADER
    And I too.

  Vader brings his mighty sword down on Luke, who deftly
  blocks the attack, but moves another step back in the
  process.  He is now standing squarely on the hydraulic
  platform.

          VADER
    Your future lies with us, Skywalker.
    Now you will embrace the dark side.
    Obi-wan knew this to be true.

          LUKE
    No!

          VADER
    There is much Obi-wan did not
    tell you.  Come, The Emperor will
    complete your training.

          LUKE
    I'll die first.

          VADER
    That won't be necessary.

  With that, there is a slight rumble and the hydraulic
  platform disappears into the vat of freezing steam,
  which rises to obscure Vader's vision.  He looks down
  into the steam.

          VADER
    All too easy.  Perhaps you are
    not as strong as The Emperor
    thought.

          LUKE (OS)
    Time will tell.

  Vader looks up in surprise to see that Luke has leapt
  fifteen feet straight up and is now hanging from some
  of the hoses on the carbonite ladle.  Luke yanks one of
  the hoses loose and swings to safety on the far side of
  the platform.  Vader moves toward Luke with overwhelming
  menace, his laser sword flaring.

          VADER
    Your agility is impressive.  Let's
    see what other skills you've learned.

  A section of pipe tears loose from the wall and flies
  toward Luke.  Luke cuts it into five pieces, which
  bounce around the chamber.

          VADER
    I feel it now ... your fear, your
    anger.  Good.  Let The Force flow.
    Hate me.  I'm the one who destroyed
    your family.

  Cases, tools, bits of pipe begin to fly at Luke.  He
  cuts down or deflects them, but is driven back by their
  onslaught.

          VADER
    Attack.  Take your revenge.
    Destroy me.

  Luke looks around for a means of escape.  There is
  only one ... a round tunnel with pipes and conduit
  running through it.  He makes his way for it as Vader
  continues to hurtle objects at him.

          VADER
    There is no escape.  You will use
    the dark side of The Force ... or
    perish.  Let your hate flow and
    save yourself.

  Luke backs into the tunnel followed by Vader.

          LANDO
    It's no use, they're out of range.

          THREEPIO
    Oh my, no!

  A laser bolt explodes near the Princess and everyone
  turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming
  from the other direction:  a squad of Stormtroopers
  running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the elevator.

          LANDO
    Come on, let's move!

  Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as
  Lando makes a break for the elevator.  Laser bolts
  continue to explode around the Princess and the Wookiee,
  but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out of
  the elevator and motions for the pair to run.  But they
  barely notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as
  all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour
  out through their death-dealing weapons.  Threepio,
  at the center of all this, is frantic.

          THREEPIO
    Artoo, help me!  How did I get
    into this? ... What a fate worse
    than death is to be strapped to
    the back of a Wookiee!

          LANDO
    Get in here!  Now!  Both of you,
    hurry up!

  Reluctantly, Leia and Chewbacca move through the rain
  of laserfire toward the elevator.  Once they're inside,
  the door slams shut and the Stormtroopers race forward.

          THREEPIO
    With all respect, I'm tempted to
    agree ...

          LEIA

    them off.

          CHEWIE
    Barks his agreement.

    You two almost signed off out there.

          THREEPIO

          LEIA
    I don't care.  It would've been
    worth it .... for Han.

          CHEWIE
    Barks his Òright on!Ó

          LANDO
    Very noble.  Not smart, but
    noble.

    honorable thing in your life.

    out lousy.

          LEIA

    cut ...

  Suddenly, the elevator stops with a jolt and the main
  lights go out, leaving only the running lights.

          CHEWIE
    Howls.

          ARTOO
    Whistles.

392 INT REACTOR CONTROL STATION         392

  Vader's powerful thrust and parry continues as Luke is
  forced back into the cluttered control area of the
  monstrous reactor that powers the city.  Luke is
  obviously outmatched by the powerful Dark Lord of the
  Sith; he must struggle to avoid Vader's slashing sword.
  The laser weapon cuts through pipes and wires, causing
  steam, fluid and sparks to fly everywhere.

  Luke moves behind a tall storage case, which is neatly
  cut in two by one of Vader's blows.  Several electronic
  tools sitting on the control panel fly at Luke.  He
  manages to deflect the projectiles and, at the same
  time, hold off his awesome opponent.  But he is battered
  cut in several places, tired and somewhat dazed.  He
  stumbles and can't catch his breath.

          VADER
    You are beaten.  It is useless to
    resist.

  Luke lunges at Vader and attempts to put the Dark Lord
  on the defensive.  He succeeds in nicking the giant
  warrior on the shoulder.  Vader reacts, but is quite
  unhurt.

          VADER
    Don't let yourself be destroyed
    as Obi-wan did.

  Luke is breathing hard but the mention of Ben has a
  curious effect on him.  He stands motionless for a
  moment, thinking.  He closes his eyes.

          LUKE
      (to himself)
    Knowledge and defense.

  A calm comes over Luke, as Vader raises his sword and
  starts another attack.  Using The Force, Vader hurtles
  large objects at Luke, but the boy deflects them with
  the good side of The Force.

  Luke is backed up against a large round window.  It
  over-looks a narrow scaffold and, beyond, an awesome
  abyss that drops away to the glowing reactor many miles
  below.

          VADER
    You will join me, or you will
    join Obi-wan in death!

  A large tool case rises and speeds toward Luke.  He
  deflects it slightly, and it smashes through the
  window creating a massive rush of air.  The gust knocks
  Luke off balance and sends him flying out the window
  after the tool case.

393 INT ELEVATOR SHAFT            393

  Lando climbs into the dimly lit elevator shaft from a
  door in the top of the elevator.  There is no cable,
  but a great deal of mechanical and electronic gadgetry.
  Leia and Chewie can be seen inside the elevator looking
  at him.  Lando fiddles with several large braking
  devices and then starts banging one with his weapon.

          LEIA
    You'd better know what you're
    doing, or this is going to get
    very messy.

          LANDO

    Don't worry about a thing.  I'll
    get us going.

  he inserts his control arm in the socket.

          THREEPIO
    Artoo can release the brakes
    through the central controls.

  Lando pops his head in as a loud clanking echoes
  through the shaft.

          LANDO
    Then do it!  They're breaking in!

          ARTOO
    Beeps a snappy okay.

  With a jolt, the brakes release and the elevator
  rockets into oblivion.  Leia, Chewie and Threepio are
  smashed to the ceiling.

  Lando manages to hang on with one hand and fire his
  laser pistol at the huge brake with the other.  A
  direct hit and the brake snaps closed, stopping the
  elevator instantly with a loud, horrible SCREECH.

398 INT GANTRY OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT   398

  The shaft is noisy with wind.  Then, the wind stops
  and all that can be heard is the echoing footsteps of
  the Dark Lord.  A haggard Luke is dangling over the
  abyss, struggling to climb back on to the gantry
  before Vader arrives.  He still holds his light saber
  as he hoists himself back onto the metal walkway.

  Vader brings his sword down before Luke can stand, but
  the young Jedi manages to block the blow.  He scrambles
  backwards down the ramp, with Vader following, slashing
  at the youth.  In the distance, the muted roar of the
  wind blast can be heard getting ever closer, until the
  two warriors are engulfed in blast of wind that almost
  knocks them off the gantry.  Luke manages to stand in
  the wind and return Vader's powerful blows.  The two
  battle furiously along the gantry.  Vader cuts away
  part of the railing that Luke is holding.  Luke notices
  with awe as the railing is lifted by the wind.  He
  lets go and the metal floats away.

  The wind stops and the fighting becomes even more
  intense.  The deadly buzz of the laser swords rever-
  berates through the vast power shaft.  An alarm sounds
  and the public address system inside the control room
  crackles.

  Luke slashes at Vader again, renewing the fight.
  Luke's sword whistles past Vader and the young warrior
  is thrown off balance, his guard down.  Vader's light
  saber flashes out with deadly skill and cuts Luke,
  almost forcing him over the edge.  He can barely stand.
  He wipes the tears from his eyes, but still can barely
  focus on his massive opponent.

399 INT CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM - BESPIN 399

  The Millennium Falcon can be seen for a moment before
  the main door leading to the landing platform slams
  shut.  Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids round a corner.
  They duck into the alcove at the main door just as
  Stormtroopers arrive at both ends of the hall and start
  firing.  The band of rebels squeeze into the little
  alcove as a rain of laser bolts stream past and explode
  around them.  Chewie blasts away at the Stormtroopers.
  Leia punches buttons on the door's control panel.

          LEIA
    We've got to find Luke.

          LANDO
    His fate is sealed.  You'll be

    can override the alert system.

  Threepio points to a computer socket on the control
  panel.  Little Artoo beeps and scoots over to the
  panel and sticks his computer arm into the socket.

          ARTOO
    A short beep turns into a wild
    scream!

  Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins around wildly
  and he begins to smoke.  Lando pulls him away.

          ARTOO

  driven to the edge of the jutting platform; he is
  ready to collapse under Vader's powerful blows.  A
  continual rain of sparks showers down on the young
  warrior from a severed power cable on the instrument
  stand.  The noise of clashing laser swords is now
  covered by the roar of wind working its way up the
  shaft.  Luke almost loses his balance and goes over the
  edge, but the wind props him up enough for him to
  regain his balance.  He attacks Vader again, with a
  vengeance, using his last reserves of strength.  The
  wind fades away again.

          VADER
    The Force runs strong in the
    Skywalker line.  You will achieve
    great power ... Come, join with
    me!  Together we will be the most
    powerful ... even stronger than
    The Emperor.

    (INSERT B - DIALOGUE ADDED HERE)

          LUKE
    No! .... Never ....

  Luke starts backing away from Vader, his strength
  gone at last.

          VADER
    There is no escape.  You must
    join me or die.  Don't make me
    destroy you here ... The Emperor
    is strong with The Force.  But
    if you join me, together we could
    overthrow Him.  Do not resist.
    It is our destiny!

          LUKE
    Never.

  Luke lunges for Vader with his laser sword, but misses.
  He stumbles to the other side of the platform.  In the
  distance, the wind can be heard working its way up the
  long shaft.  Luke is out of breath, exhausted, bleeding.
  He hears the wind rising and gives Vader a long, hard
  look.

          LUKE
    Never!

  Luke staggers to the edge of the platform and jumps
  off into the endless abyss.  Vader rages in disbelief.

          VADER
    No!

  The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke
  falling far below.  The wind begins to blow at Vader's
  cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from
  the edge.  He looks out and sees Luke floating upward
  past him with the force of the wind.

  Spread-eagle, skydiver-style, Luke attempts to maneuver
  himself closer to the side of the shaft.  He has hooked
  his laser sword to his belt.  The wind begins to fade
  and the wounded Jedi begins to fall fast, unable to
  grab onto anything.

401 INT - SHAFT - SMALL EXHAUST PIPE          401

  Suddenly, Luke is sucked into a small exhaust pipe in
  the side of the shaft.  Vader sees this.  He turns and
  hurries off the platform.

  pipe.

  FULL SHOT - Luke hanging on weather vane on bottom of
  the city.

  Dangling helplessly above the awesome cloud sea hundreds
  of miles below, he struggles in vain to pull himself
  to safety.  Finally, he closes his eyes and begins to
  concentrate.

          LUKE
    Leia, Leia .... Leia, I need you.

  Luke swings in the gentle breeze of the cloud planet.

405 INT CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM      405

  Artoo has dismantled the control panel next to the
  service door and is working with the wires.  His work
  has enabled Lando to hook into the public address
  system.  Now he yells into a microphone over the din of
  the continuing battle with the Stormtroopers.

          LANDO
    This is Baron Calrissian.  The
    Empire is taking control of the
    city.  Evacuate immediately.
    Leave before more Imperial troops
    arrive.

  An explosion hits nearby.  Artoo touches two wires
  together and the door slides open.  Artoo whistles.
  Lando, Chewie, Leia and Threepio are ecstatically
  surprised.

          THREEPIO
    Artoo, you did it!  I never
    doubted you for a second ...

          LEIA
    Let's go.

  Artoo lays down a cloud of fog, obscuring everything,
  as the group dashes outside.

406 EXT LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK      406

  The group races for the Millennium Falcon as Storm-
  troopers reach the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off

  to whine, Lando and Leia jump on board.

407 EXT BOTTOM OF CITY - EXHAUST PIPE - DUSK      407

  MED SHOT - Luke hanging on weather vane on bottom of
  the city.  He has attained a better position on the
  weather vane and managed to hook one of his legs around
  the fragile instrument.

          LUKE
    Leia .... Leia ....

  There is an ominous CRACKING sound from the base of
  the weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into
  the clouds far below.  A rush of air is constantly
  blowing from the pipe.

408 INT COCKPIT - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CITY - DUSK 408

  Chewie pulls back on the controls as Leia and Lando
  make their way into the cabin.  Lando sits in the
  co-pilot's seat.  Leia sits next to one of the control
  panels.  Suddenly, Leia seems to hear something.  She
  turns to Lando with a quizzical look.

          LEIA
    What'd you say?

          LANDO
    I didn't say anything?

  Leia shrugs and turns back to Chewie.

  MED SHOT of Luke dangling from weather vane.

  The weather vane makes another terrifying CRACK and
  lurches a little more to one side.  Luke is so weary
  and in such pain, he almost doesn't notice.  He is
  concentrating on The Force.

          LUKE

    to last .... I'm going to miss it.

          LEIA
    Luke!

          LANDO
    What?

          LEIA
    Luke needs help.  We must go back.

          CHEWIE
    Barks his consternation.

          LEIA
    Chewie, head for the bottom of
    the city.

          LANDO
    Three patrol ships are heading
    our way.

          CHEWIE
    Barks an argument and shakes his
    head.

          LEIA
    No argument, just do it.  That's
    a command!

          LANDO
    Wait a minute.  We're not going
    back there.

          CHEWIE
    Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with
    an ominous growl.

    Two more ships are closing.

  Leia reaches over and speaks into the com-link.

          LEIA
    Lando, is he alright? ... Lando?
    Are you there?  How's Luke?

          LUKE (OS)
    He'll survive.

  Leia and Chewie turn to see the bloody and battered
  Jedi, supported by Lando in the cockpit entry.  Lando
  has wrapped a blanket around him.  Leia jumps up and
  gives him a giant hug.

          CHEWIE

          LEIA
    This hyperdrive had better work.

          LUKE
    I've never seen it fail.

  Leia and Chewie exchange a look.

          LANDO
    I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've
    got nothing to worry about.

          LEIA
