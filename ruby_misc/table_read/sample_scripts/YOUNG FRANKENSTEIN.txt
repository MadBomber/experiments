  FADE IN

1 EXT. FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE              1

  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

  A CRACK OF THUNDER!

  On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as
  we knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF
  LIGHTNING.

  MUSIC:  AN EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY begins to PLAY in
  the b.g.

2 ANOTHER ANGLE               2

  as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle.  It is completely
  dark, except for one room -- a study in the corner of the
  castle -- which is only lit by candles.

  Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the
  study.  We LOOK IN and SEE:

3 INT. STUDY - NIGHT                3

  An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.
  As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW...

  A CLOCK BEGINS TO CHIME:  "ONE," "TWO," "THREE," "FOUR..."

  We are ALMOST FACING the front of the coffin.  "FIVE,"
  "SIX," "SEVEN," "EIGHT..."

  The CAMERA STOPS.  Now it MOVES UP AND ABOVE the satin-lined
  coffin.  "NINE," "TEN," "ELEVEN," "T W E L V E!"

                    CUT TO:

4 THE EMBALMED HEAD OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN        4

  Half of still clings to the waxen balm; the other
  half has decayed to skull.  Below his head is a skeleton,
  whose bony fingers cling to a metal box.

5 A HAND                    5

  reaches in to grasp the metal box.  It lifts the box halfway
  out of the coffin -- the skeleton's fingers rising, involun-
  tarily, with the box.

                    Cont.

                      2

                      5 Cont.

  Then, as of by force of will, the skeleton's fingers grab
  the box back and place it where it was.

  Now the "Hand" -- using its other hand -- grabs the box
  back from the skeleton's fingers.  The skeleton no longer
  resists.

6 CORNELIUS WALDMAN               6

  whose "Hands" we have just seen, now carries the box to a
  small table.  He takes a tiny key out from his vest pocket
  and begins to unlock the metal box.

  NINE PEOPLE watch him closely.  They are seated on chairs
  in the study, waiting to hear the contents of
  Beaufort Frankenstein's will.  Their dress is turn-of-the-
  century Transylvanian.

  Cornelius Waldman fumbles with the lock, emitting strange
  grunts as he tries to open it.  With each grunt, the face
  of a "potential Heir" is SEEN, squirming with frustration
  or anger.

          FIRST VILLAGER (WALTER)
      Fumbling fool!  For two kronen
      I'd rip that box fight out of his
      hands.

          ILSE (HIS WIFE)
      Shhh!

          NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER (HENRICH)
      Hurry.  Idiot, hurry!

          AGATHA (HIS WIFE)
      Quiet, Henrich!  We've waited seventy
      years...another three or four seconds
      won't hurt.

          NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER
      Another three of four more seconds?
      I could be dead by then.

          AGATHA
      Shhh!

          FIFTH VILLAGER (A MAN)
      What if he's left you out?

          HELENE (HIS GIRL FRIEND)
      Just let him try -- I'll take care
      of him.

                    Cont.

                      6 Cont.

          ANASTASIA (A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
      Oh, Mommy...I hardly remember.  Did
      the Baron really like me when I was
      a child?

          MARLENE (HER MOTHER)
      Like a father!

          NINTH VILLAGER (WOLFGANG)
        (muttering to
        himself)
      Wenn dieser Bloder kerl sich nicht
      beeilt verde ich verruckt.  Was zum
      Teufel machte?

          MARLENE
      Shhh!

  Cornelius Waldman finally opens the lock.  He takes out an
  old parchment, puts on his glasses, coughs and sputters a
  few times, and then begins to read.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      'I, Beaufort Frankenstein, in this
      my eighty third year of life, do
      hereby make, publish and declare the
      following statements as and for my
      last will and testament, and I direct
      my executor, Cornelius Waldman, to
      inform and assemble those persons
      previously divulged to him, that
      they may hear -- in my own voice --
      the final disposition of my property.'

  At the words, "In my own voice," the nine "Potential Heirs"
  exchange curious glances.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
        (still reading)
      'Such disposition to commerce at
      the hour of twelve o'clock of my
      one hundredth birthday.  If all
      the conditions heretofore set forth
      have been met, now then -- hear once
      more, and for the last time...the
      authenticity of my own voice!'

  Cornelius Waldman nos to a Clerk, HERR FALKSTEIN, who
  is standing nearby.

  Herr Falkstein places the needle of an old victrola onto
  an already spinning record.  It SCRATCHES and then begins
  to PLAY.

          VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN
        (o.s.)
      How do you do this thing?  Where?
      In here?  Just talk right into it?
      All right. Am I close enough?  All
      right, all right -- get the hell
      out of the way.
        (he clears his throat,
        then speaks in a deep,
        majestic voice)
      The once proud name of Frankenstein
      has been dragged, by my only son,
      Victor, into an abyss of shame.
      There was a time when the name
      'Frankenstein' conjured dreams of
      virtue, of honor and devotion.  Now,
      no guilt, no malignity, no misery
      can be found to equal mine.  And
      the catalogue of sins of my once
      devoted son will not cease to
      rankle in my wounds until death
      shall close them forever -- so
      supremely frightful is the effect
      of any human endeavor to mock the
      stupendous mechanism of the Creator
      of the world.
      Did you get all that?  Are you sure
      you got 'rankle in my wounds'?  I'll
      kill you if you screw this up.  All
      right, all right. Now as to the
      disposition of my estate.

  Everyone in the room sits alert.

          VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN

  SCRATCH, SCRATCH, SCRATCH...the needle has reached the
  end of the first side.

  lifts the arm off and turns the record over.

          HERR FALKSTEIN
        (apologetically)
      It's a seventy eight.

  He places the needle on the record.

          VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN
        (o.s.)
      ...Unless...my only male heir, my
      great-grandson, Frederick -- whom I
      have never seen but who is, at the
      time of this recording, ten years of
      age and residing in America with my
      granddaughter, Katherine -- has, by
      his own free will, embraced Medicine
      as his career and acquitted himself
      with some measure of esteem.  Then,
      to him I leave...everything!

  The nine "Potential Heirs" are expressionless.

      laboratory, its public and private
      library, and all notes and journals
      contained therein, all acreage
      surrounding my estate, plus all
      income and principle thereof...in
      the fond hope that yet another
      Frankenstein shall lift our family
      name to an eminence of dignity, and
      sanity, that it once enjoyed.

      As for my dear friends and relations,
      should this latter improbability come
      to be...I know that I have your
      complete understanding.  For the road
      to salvation and repentance must be
      paved up the avenue of my soul, and
      not up yours, up yours, up yours,
      up yours, up yours...

  Herr Falkstein removes the needle from the finished record.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform
      Frederick Frankenstein of this
      assembly and all the particulars
      of the time and place?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      I did, sir.

  He takes a cablegram out from his pocket.

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      But I received a cable only this
      morning, saying that he could not
      come.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      Was he aware of the importance of
      this occasion?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he
      was obligated to lecture at
      Johns Hopkins University.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      What lecture could be more
      important than the will of
      Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
        (reading the cable)
      'Functional areas of the cerebrum
      in relation to the skull.'

  The Ninety-Year-Old Villager passes out.

        (very sweetly)
      Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me
      for interrupting.  But is Frederick,
      then...a medical doctor?

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      Yes, my dear, he is.

          ANASTASIA
      And has he achieved...any special
      degree of eminence?

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      He is the fifth leading authority
      in his field.

          ANASTASIA
        (sinking her head
        into her hand)
      Oh, shit.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      Herr Falkstein -- you must go at
      once and present Dr. Frankenstein
      with all the details of his
      inheritance.  The estate will
      provide for your journey.

          HELENE
      I object, Herr Waldman!  This is a
      travesty.  If the beloved great-
      grandson cared anything at all for
      the House of Frankenstein, he would
      have shown it by being here with
      those of us who still have some
      respect.  I think we should completely
      disregard the afterthoughts of a very
      old man.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      Madam -- the foundation of civilization
      rests upon adherence to the law.  And
      the Law is the Law.  Das Gesetz ist
      das Gesetz!

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Yes, sir.

          CORNELIUS WALDMAN
      I have taken an oath that each
      letter of this testament shall
      be executed...and by God, it
      shall be done!

20  INT. MEDICAL ARENA - DAY              20

  Herr Falkstein quietly enters into the balcony of an
  arena packed with young MEDICAL STUDENTS.  A lecture is
  in progress.

          LECTURER'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      If we look at the base of a brain
      which has just been removed from
      a skull, there's very little of
      the midbrain that we can actually
      see.

                      10

                      20 Cont.

  Herr Falkstein proceeds, almost on tiptoe, along the
  aisle towards a vacant seat.  He is carrying a briefcase
  and a small metal box.

          LECTURER'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      Yet, as I demonstrated in my
      lecture last week, if the under
      aspects of the temporal lobes
      are gently pulled apart, the
      upper portion of the stem of
      the brain can be seen.

  Herr Falkstein's footsteps ECHO ever so lightly against
  the cold stone floor, as he passes the faces of students
  intense with concentration.

          LECTURER'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      This so called 'brain stem'
      consists of the midbrain, a
      rounded protrusion called the
      pons, and a stalk tapering
      downwards called the
      medulla oblongata which passes
      out of the skull through the
      foramen magnum and becomes,
      of course...the spinal cord.

  Herr Falkstein finds a vacant place and sits down.

          LECTURER'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      Which brings us directly to the
      demonstration prepared for today.
      Are there any questions before
      we proceed?

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      (rising)
      I have one question,
      Dr. Frankenstein.

21  ANOTHER ANGLE               21

  Our first LOOK at the famous Lecturer.

          FREDDY
      That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      I beg your pardon?

          FREDDY
      My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.

          FREDDY
      No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      But aren't you the grandson of the
      famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?...
      who performed such fascinating
      experiments in electricity and
      galvanism?

          FREDDY
      That's true!  But my grandfather,
      Victor was, after all, what we
      might politely refer to as... a
      cuckoo!

  Polite laughter.

          FREDDY
      I prefer, by far, to be remembered
      for my own small contributions to
      science.  Now if we can proceed to
      your questions.

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      Well sir... I'm not sure I
      understand the distinction between
      'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve
      impulses.

          FREDDY
      Very good!  Since our lab work today
      is a demonstration of just that
      distinction... why don't we proceed?

  Behind Freddy is a PATIENT, lying on an operating table.
  CARLSON, an assistant, stands near the Patient, next to
  a small table of instruments.

                    Cont.

                      12

                      21 Cont.

          FREDDY
      What are we actually talking about
      when we use the term, 'Brain'?  We
      are talking about... a cauliflower!

  Freddy turns to Carlson.

          FREDDY
      May I have the cauliflower, please!

  Carlson hands Freddy a giant cauliflower.

          FREDDY
      If we make a small slit, down the
      center of this cauliflower...

  Freddy turns to Carlson, who hands him the scalpel.  Freddy
  makes a small slit down the center of the cauliflower.

          FREDDY
      ...and then, ever so gently,
      gently, gently... pull it apart...

  Freddy has some difficulty pulling the cauliflower apart.
  It begins to crumble, but he goes on, professionally.

          FREDDY
      ...we should find, with any luck
      at all... a stalk of... celery!

  There is no celery inside the cauliflower.  Freddy flushes
  red.

          FREDDY
        (to Carlson)
      Where did you get this cauliflower?

          CARLSON
      From your office, sir.

          FREDDY
      Didn't you prepare it with the
      celery before my lecture?

          CARLSON
      Yes, sir.  But I must have taken
      the wrong one when we came up.

          FREDDY
        (in quiet rage)
      Are you trying to make me look
      like an idiot?

                    Cont.

                      21 Cont.1

          CARLSON
      No, sir.  It will never happen again.

          FREDDY
        (handing him
        the cauliflower)
      Here!  This cauliflower is useless
      to me.

  Freddy turns back to his audience.

          FREDDY
      With any normal cauliflower, we
      would have found a stalk of celery,
      or... 'Brain Stem' which brings us
      to the practical application of
      our study.

  Freddy moves behind the Patient on the table.

          FREDDY
      Mr. Hilltop here -- with whom I have
      never worked of given any prior
      instructions to -- has graciously
      offered his services for this afternoon's
      demonstration.  Mr. Hilltop!

          HILLTOP
      Yes, sir?

          FREDDY
      Have we ever seen each other before
      this afternoon?

          HILLTOP
      No, sir.
          FREDDY
      Tell them!

          HILLTOP
        (turning to the
        Medical Students)
      No, sir -- we haven't.

  FREDDY
        (to his audience)
      Do I lie?
        (to Mr. Hilltop)
      Would you be so kind enough to hop
      up on your feet and stand beside
      this table.

          FREDDY
      Mr. Hilltop!  Would you raise
      your left knee, please!

  Mr. Hilltop raises his left knee.

          FREDDY
      You have just witnessed a 'Voluntary'
      nerve impulse.  It begins as a
      stimulus from the cerebral cortex,
      passes through the brain stem and
      then to the particular muscle
      involved.  Mr. Hilltop, you may
      lower your knee.

  He lowers his knee.

          FREDDY
      'Reflex movements are those which
      are made independently of the will,
      but are carried out along pathways
      which pass between the periphery and
      the central nervous system.  You
      filthy, rotten, yellow son of a BITCH!

  Freddy pokes his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's balls.
  Mr. Hilltop reacts accordingly.

          FREDDY
      We are not aware of the impulses,
      neither do we intend them to contract
      our muscles.  Yet -- as you can see --
      they work by themselves.

  By this time, Mr. Hilltop has lowered his protective thigh
  ... a little nervously.

          FREDDY
      Now then!  Modern research has
      shown us that by simply applying
      local pressure of ' blocking' the
      nerve impulse... which can be done
      with any ordinary metal clamp...

  Freddy reaches out his hand.  Carlson hands him a bicycle
  clamp.  Freddy holds Mr. Hilltop's head and places the
  clamp behind Mr. Hilltop's ears.

          FREDDY
      ... Just at the swelling on the
      posterior nerve root -- for, oh
      say five or six seconds...

  A short pause.  Freddy looks at his watch.

          FREDDY
      Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!

  Freddy once again jerks his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's
  balls.  This time Mr. Hilltop doesn't move.  He is almost
  ready to pass out.

          FREDDY
      All communication is shut off.
      Similarly, damage to a nerve will
      mean that not all the impulses can
      get through and there will be
      weakness of a muscle...

  Mr. Hilltop collapses to the floor.  Freddy never looks down.

          FREDDY
      ...or group of muscles, with some
      loss of skin sensation on the area
      supplied by that nerve.  In spite
      of our mechanical magnificence, if
      there is not this continuous stream
      of impulses... we would collapse
      like... a bunch of broccoli.

  A smattering of POLITE APPLAUSE.  Freddy reaches down and
  removes the metal clamp from Mr. Hilltop's head.

          FREDDY
        (to Carlson)
      Give him an extra dollar.

          CARLSON
      Yes, sir.

  Carlson picks up Mr. Hilltop and places him on the operating
  table.

          FREDDY
      In conclusion... it should be noted
      that more than common injury to the
      nerve roots is always serious,
      because... once a nerve fibber is
      severed... there is no way to
      regenerate life back into it.  Are
      there any more questions before we
      leave?

          MEDICAL STUDENT
      Vermicelli.

          FREDDY
      Are you speaking of the worm, or
      ... the spaghetti.

          FREDDY
      Why the worm, Sir.

          FREDDY
      Ah!  In science you must be very
      precise -- it can spell the
      difference between life and death.
        (to Carlson)
      I don't want that fellow in class

          CARLSON
      Yes, sir.

         (to Medical Student)
      Yes!  It seems to me I did read
      something about that incident as a
      student.  But you have to remember
      that a worm -- with very few exceptions
      -- is not a human being.

          MEDICAL STUDENT

          FREDDY
      Nineteen!  My dear young man...
      once the human organism has ceased
      to function, nature has deemed
      that creature to be dead.

22  EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY              22

  Herr Falkstein and Freddy are walking along the sidewalk.
  In the distance, a little OLD VIOLINIST, wearing a
  Tyrolean hat, plays a cheerful tune on his violin.  His
  open violin case rests on the ground beside him.

          FREDDY
      One hundred thousand dollars???

      Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone
      is worth a small fortune.

          FREDDY
      But I can't just drop everything and
      leave.  I have responsibilities and
      obligations.

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Do you have a hundred thousand of
      them, sir?

  Freddy looks at Herr Falkstein.  The little Old Violinist
  has finished his cheerful tune.  He now plays the eerie
  Transylvanian Lullaby that was heard at the opening.

          FREDDY
      How long will this whole thing
      take?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      A week.  Ten days at most.

          FREDDY
      I'll have to think it over.  It's
      not so easy just to pick up and...

  Freddy stops -- the music seeping into a dark and forgotten
  corner of his brain.

          FREDDY
      Curious melody!  Haunting, isn't
      it?

  Freddy, followed by Herr Falkstein, walks back a few steps
  and stands next to the Old Violinist as he plays.

          FREDDY
      What's that tune that you're playing

          OLD VIOLINIST
      Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.

          FREDDY
      How sweet!  Such a quaint little
      tune.

  Freddy rubs his temples with his fingertips for a moment.

          OLD VIOLINIST
        (handing Freddy
        the violin)
      It's an honor for me, sir.  You
      play the violin?

          FREDDY
      Oh, just a little.

  Freddy examines the violin.

          FREDDY
      Nice!  Nice little balance to it.

          OLD VIOLINIST
      Ja, ja.

  Freddy, without any emotion, smashes the violin over his knee
  and then hands the two halves back to the Old Violinist.

          FREDDY
      Thank you very much.

  The Old Violinist takes the two halves, open-mouthed.

          FREDDY
        (to Herr Falkstein)
      Well... if you're sure that I could
      accomplish everything in a week...
      I suppose I could manage it.

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Why did you do that?

          FREDDY
      What?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Break that old man's violin.

          FREDDY
      I didn't do that.

  Now Freddy and Herr Falkstein are standing on a corner.

          FREDDY
      All right then, I suppose I owe
      the family that much.  You'll
      have everything ready for me when
      I arrive?

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Yes, sir.

      One week -- I'll see to it, sir.

          FREDDY
      Well, thank you very much for all
      your trouble.

  They shake hands.

          HERR FALKSTEIN
      Not at all -- a great privilege,
      Doctor.

          FREDDY
      Saturday night then!  I'll take
      the train to New York and fly from
      there.

      Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a

  Freddy walks off.  Herr Falkstein looks back at the little

  Freddy, struggling with his suitcase, stares in polite
  horror at the two men as he and Inga walk past them.

          FREDDY
      Good evening.

          DRACULA
      Good evening.

          WOLFMAN
      Good evening.

  Freddy and Inga continue on, walking under a dangling
  sign:

      "TRANSYLVANIA STATION"

                    DISSOLVE TO:

36  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT     36

  A cart, drawn by two horses, travels up a lonely road.
  Igor is at the reins.  In the back, sitting in mountains
  of hay, are Freddy and Inga.

          INGA
      Did you ever have a roll in
      the hay?

          FREDDY
        (a little nervous)
      I'm not sure I...get your drift.

  Inga begins to roll herself over and over in the hay.

          INGA
      You should try it -- it's fun.

  Somewhat embarrassed, Freddy leans over to speak to Igor.

          FREDDY
      Incidentally -- I don't mean
      to embarrass you in any way,
      but I'm a rather brilliant
      surgeon.  Perhaps I can help
      you with that hump.

          IGOR
      What hump?

  Freddy tries to recover.

          FREDDY
      Well...perhaps we can talk
      about it later.

  He turns back to Inga for relief.  Just then:  a BOLT OF
  LIGHTNING!  Inga comes close to Freddy.

          INGA
      Sometimes I'm afraid of the
      lightning.

          FREDDY
      Just an atmospheric discharge.
      Nothing to be afraid of.

  A HORRIFYING CRY OF A WOLF!

          FREDDY
        (making a joke)
      Werewolf.

          IGOR
      There.

          FREDDY
      I beg your pardon?

          IGOR
        (pointing to
        the woods)
      There wolf!
        (pointing up
        the road)
      There castle!

          FREDDY
      Why are you talking like that?

          IGOR
      I thought you wanted to.

          FREDDY
      No.

      Suit yourself...I'm easy.
        (confidentially,
        indicating Inga)
      Better watch out for the wockers.

          FREDDY
      What wockers?

          IGOR
      The wockers with the knockers.

          FREDDY
      Wockers with the knockers???

          IGOR
      Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll
      lose your sockers and then
      be fockers.

  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

          IGOR
        (pointing to the
        top of the hill)
      Well, there it is...

        see the castle)
      Home!

          FREDDY
        (to himself)
      Home.

                      31

38  EXT. THE CASTLE               38

  As they approach the gigantic front door, FRAU BLUCHER
  opens a smaller door, within the giant door, and stands
  on the front stairs to greet them.  She holds a lit
  candelabra.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Welcome!  I am Frau Blucher.

  At the sound of her name, the HORSES REAR.

          IGOR
      Down!  Down!  Steady!!

  Freddy takes his suitcase and helps Inga out of the cart.
  He approaches Frau Blucher.

          FREDDY
      How do you do?  I am Dr. Fronkonsteen.
      This is my assistant.  Inga -- may
      I present Frau Blucher.

  The HORSES REAR.

          IGOR
      Down!  Get down, you beasts!

          FREDDY
      I wonder what's got into them?

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Your rooms are ready, Herr Doctor.
      If you will follow me, please.

  She indicates the small door.

          FREDDY
        (calling to Igor)
      Aye-gor!  We'll wait for you
      inside.  Hurry, please!

  He turns to the door.

          FREDDY
      After you Frau Blucher.

  The HORSES REAR.  Freddy, Inga and Frau Blucher have
  disappeared through the small door.  Igor struggles with
  the rearing horses.

          IGOR
      Easy.  Easy!  What's very sticky
      and rhymes with shoe?

  The horses calm down.

          IGOR
      That's better.

  Igor takes Freddy's briefcase and heads for the door.

          IGOR
        (to the horses)
      I'll be back shortly.  Just
      think of model airplanes.

  Igor shuns the smaller door and pulls the handle that opens
  the giant door.  He walks into the castle.

                    CUT TO:

39  INT. RECEPTION HALL             39

  Frau Blucher is waiting on a large staircase with Freddy
  and Inga.  Igor comes up to them.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Shall we proceed?

  They all follow in the aura of Frau Blucher's candlelight.
  From outside there is a:  LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER.  When
  they reach the top of the stairs, Frau Blucher starts
  down a corridor.  Igor walks up to a light switch and
  tries it.

40  ANOTHER ANGLE               40

  as ALL THE LIGHTS COME ON.  Igor turns the lights off again,
  gesturing to Freddy not to say anything because Frau Blucher
  might be a little bonkers.  Inga, Freddy and Igor turn
  into the corridor and disappear.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

41  INT. FREDDY'S BEDROOM             41

  A fire is going in the fire place.  Candles are lit in wall
  sconces.  One wall is devoted to books.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      I hope you find this comfortable.
      This was Baron Victor's room.

          FREDDY
      It seems fine.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      You'll fine the keys to all the
      rooms in my cas... all the rooms
      in your castle on this ring.  I'll
      leave it on the table here.

          FREDDY
      Does that include the key to the
      laboratory?

                    Cont.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      You mean... the laboratory??

          FREDDY
      Yes!... the laboratory.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept
      that separate.

          FREDDY
      May I have it, please?

  A pregnant pause.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Of course.

  She pulls up on a chain around her neck.  At the end of
  the chain is a key that had been resting against her bosom.
  She takes it off, kisses it quickly, and sets it on the table.

          FREDDY
        (examining the
        bookcase)
      There seem to be quite a few books.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's
      medical library.

          FREDDY
      I see.  And where is my grandfather's
      private library?

          FRAU BLUCHER
      I don't know what you mean, sir.

          FREDDY
      well, there was a public and a
      private library -- he said so in his
      will.  these books are all very
      general -- any doctor might have them
      in his study.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      This is the only library I know of.

          FREDDY
      Surely he kept his notes -- his private
      papers and records in some other place?

          FRAU BLUCHER
      I think you must be mistaken, sir.

      Well... we'll see.

          FRAU BLUCHER
      Will there be anything else?

          FREDDY
      I don't think so.  Is my assistant
      taken care of?

          FRAU BLUCHER
      I put her in the guest room, just
      down the hall.

          FREDDY
      Good.

  She leaves.  Freddy starts back towards the bookcase and
  pulls book.

42  ANOTHER ANGLE               42

  Door opens and Inga enters.

          INGA
      Are you busy?

          FREDDY
      That's quite all right.  What is it,
      dear?

          INGA
      Could I lie down in your bed for a
      little while?  I just can't sleep.

          FREDDY
      We only arrived a few minutes ago.

          INGA
      I know, but usually I can fall
      asleep right away.  It must be the
      strange room.

          FREDDY
      Well...

          INGA
      Oh please -- just till I get sleepy.
      Then you can force me right back to
      my room.

          FREDDY
      Well.. I suppose it would be all
      right, for just a little while.

  Inga gets into Freddy's bed.

          FREDDY
      Would you like a sandwich?

          INGA
      No, thanks!  I want to get right
      to sleep.

          FREDDY
      Well... I'll just finish unpacking.

  As Freddy continues to unpack, he hears a STRANGE "BLOWING"
  SOUND coming from outside.  He goes to the window and
  looks up.

                    CUT TO:

443 A TURRET AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE         43

  Igor sits in the window, trying to blow a ram's horn.  He
  tries and tries, but can't get one good sustained not.
  Finally, he throws the ram's horns away and picks up a
  trumpet.  He blows some "SWEET" BLUES.

                    CUT TO:

44  FREDDY                    44

  lying in a chaise lounge near the bed, reading.  He wears
  his robe over his clothes.  Freddy looks at Inga, who is
  sound asleep.  Now he drains the last of his glass of
  fruit juice and sets it down on an end table.  he turns
  over to sleep.  The CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN SLOWLY to the
  bedroom window.  On its way, we SEE:  A FEW DROPS OF FRUIT
  JUICE dripping down the inside of the glass that Freddy
  has just put down.

46  LATER THAT NIGHT                46

  Deadly silence!  As the CAMERA PANS from the clouds,
  SLOWLY BACK ACROSS THE ROOM, suddenly -- from the deep
  recesses or the castle -- A VIOLIN IS HEARD PLAYING:  THE
  EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY.  As the CAMERA reaches Freddy,
  he is tossing restlessly in his sleep.

      Stop it.  Stop it, I tell you
      I don't want to be perfect.  Can't
      you understand that?  I don't want
      to be perfect!

  Freddy wakes with a start.  He sits up and listens to the
  MUSIC.  Then he stands and crosses to the bed.

          FREDDY
      Inga!

        INGA
        (in her sleep)
      Yes, you may... but don't make
      any noise.

          FREDDY
        (shaking her)
      Inga, wake up!

          INGA
      (slowly waking)
      What is it?  Is something wrong,
      Doctor?

          FREDDY
      Listen!  Don't you hear that
      strange music?

          INGA
        (listening)
      Yes!  What could it be at this hour?

          FREDDY
      I don't know.  It just woke me up.

  Freddy goes to the bookcase; Inga follows.

          FREDDY
      It seem to be coming from behind
      this bookcase.

  He puts his ear against the books and then fells for some
  hidden button or handle.

          FREDDY
      Hand me one of those candles!

  Inga takes a candle from a wall sconce and hands it to
  Freddy.  He looks closely at the books, examining some of
  the titles.  One title reads:

                      37

47  INSERT - TITLE                47

  "SEX AND HAIR GROWTH:  IT'S UP TO YOU"

48  FREDDY                    48

  out of amazement, pulls the book from the shelf.

49  ANOTHER ANGLE               49

  A SMALL DOOR OPENS IN THE BOOKCASE.

          INGA
      Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!

        FREDDY
        (listening through
        the open door)
      Whatever it is, it's coming from
      down there.  I'm going down to see.

          INGA
      Let me come with you, Doctor,
      please!  I don't want to stay up
      here alone.

          FREDDY
      All right then, quietly!  Close
      your robe and stay right behind me.
      Don't make a sound!

  They enter the secret passage.

50  INT. SECRET PASSAGE             50

  Freddy, holding the candle above them, follows the MUSIC
  down a narrow, winding stairway.  The source of the MUSIC
  gets CLOSER and CLOSER, as they follow the yellow candle-
  light down, down, down... brushing against the cobwebbed
  walls.  As they pass one section of wall, an ancient sign
  can just barely be made out in the after glow of their
  light.  It reads:

      CAPACITY:  NOT MORE THAN 3 PERSONS

            By order of:

            FIRE DEPT.

  Finally, they reach a landing.  A door separates them from
  whatever lies beyond.  Freddy takes hold of the handle...
  it crumbles in his hand like dust.  He gently pushes
  against the door.  It CREAKS slowly open.  The VIOLIN
  MUSIC STOPS!

                      38

51  INT. VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN'S LABORATORY         51

  Freddy and Inga walk into the now famous room.  A strange
  light comes from around a corner.  As they walk towards
  the light, they pass a shelf lined with skulls.  They
  look at each ancient head as they pass.  Inga shudder
  with horror.

  The forth head is Igor.  It looks as if his head is on
  the shelf, but actually he is standing just behind the
  shelf.  He smiles.

          FREDDY
      Aye-gor!

          IGOR
      Fro-derick!

          FREDDY
      What are you doing here?

          IGOR
      I got frightened all alone upstairs,
      so I came down here.

  He leads them around the corner, where a glass bowl filled
  with water is being heated by small flame.

          FREDDY
      But what you were doing?

          IGOR
      Just putting up some tea.

          FREDDY
      Did you hear that strange music?

          IGOR
      What?

          FREDDY
      Did you hear that strange music??

          IGOR

          IGOR
      No, not sound.

          INGA
      There must have been someone else
      down here then.

          FREDDY
      It seems that way.
        (to Igor)
      You didn't hear any music at all?

          IGOR
      What?

          FREDDY
      You didn't hear... nothing!
      Aren't there any lights in this
      place?

          IGOR
      Two switches over there, but I
      wasn't going to be the first.

  Freddy walks over and throws the first switch.  OPEN ENDED
  ELECTRICAL CURRENTS SHOOT OUT ALL OVER.

          IGOR
      Well, it's all right for
      atmosphere.

  Freddy turns off the first switch and then throws the other
  one.

52  "NORMAL" LIGHTS GO ON             52

  Now the lab can be SEEN in all its old splendor, but thick
  in dust and spiders' webs.

          INGA
      Ooh!

          FREDDY
      What a filthy mess.

          IGOR
      I don't know... a little paint,
      some flowers...

      Did you see anyone else down here?

          IGOR
      No, but when I first came in, there
      was a light coming from behind that
      steel door.

  A huge steel door is open a few inches.  Freddy goes to
  the door and listens, then opens it and they all walk in...
  hesitantly.

53  INT. PRIVATE LIBRARY              53

  By the light of Freddy's candle, they see a small, creepy
  room, filled with musty books.  There is a table in the
  center of the floor.  On the table there is a large book,
  an ashtray, and a VIOLIN AND BOW.

          INGA
        (seeing the violin)
      Look, Doctor!

          FREDDY
      Well, this explains the music.

          INGA
      But who was playing it?

  There is a smoldering cigar in the ashtray.

          FREDDY
      I don't know, but whoever it was
      barely finished putting out his
      cigar.  It's still smoldering.
        (to Igor)
      Let me smell your breath.

  Igor exhales in Freddy's face.  Freddy nearly passes out.

          FREDDY
      Well, it wasn't you.

  He looks around the room.

          FREDDY
      What is this place?

          IGOR
      Must be the music room.

          INGA
      There's nothing but books and papers.

      I wonder...

  He looks at the large book lying on the table.  He puts
  his candle over the cover.  A LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER as
  we SEE:

54  CLOSE SHOT - BOOK               54

  "HOW I DID IT" BY VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.  Camera pulls back.

          FREDDY
      It is!  This was my grandfather's
      private library.  Look at this!

          IGOR
        (reading the cover
        of the book)
      'How I Did It.'  Good title!

          FREDDY
      Funny it should just be lying out
      here on the table.  I wonder what
      kind of dribble this is?

  He opens to the first page.

          FREDDY
        (reading aloud)
      'Whence, I often asked myself,
      did the principles of life proceed?
      To examine the causes of life... we

      God, what a looney bin!

  ANOTHER LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER.  Freddy's candle almost
  blows out from a draft.

          INGA
      Oh, doctor!

          FREDDY
      Perhaps we'd better leave.

          IGOR
      Taking the book along?

          FREDDY
      Yes, I think we could all use a
      good laugh.

  Freddy is convulsed with laughter.

          FREDDY
      This guy is too much.

  Inga and Igor stare passively.  The three of them are
  drinking tea.  More water is boiling in a test tube.

          FREDDY
        (reading)
      '...and as soon as the dazzling
      light vanished, the oak tree had
      disappeared.  I knew then that
      electricity and galvanism had
      changed my life.'

  He howls.

          FREDDY
      This guy is bonkers!  Did you
      ever hear anything like this??

  ANOTHER LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER.

  As Freddy goes on reading, the CAMERA TRAVELS UP, UP, UP...
  THROUGH the giant laboratory... as if to seek the source
  of the THUNDER we HEAR, as the CAMERA MOVES UP:

          FREDDY'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      'When I look back now, it seems
      to me as if this almost miraculous
      event obliterated any last effort
      by the spirit of preservation to
      avert the storm that was even then
      hanging in the stars.'

  MORE THUNDER.

          FREDDY'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      He kills me!  This guy kills me.

  The CAMERA FINDS a large opening in the ceiling -- an
  opening through which bodies might be elevated during an
  electrical storm.  THUNDER CLOUDS CAN BE SEEN as the
  CAMERA PASSES THROUGH the opening into the night air.

  FREDDY'S LAUGHTER is still HEARD from below.  there is a
  GIANT CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING - as if in reply.

  Now the CAMERA TRAVELS DOWN.  Time has passes and Freddy's
  voice is hoarse, and more intense, and as the CAMERA TRAVELS
  DOWN:

      'Until, from the midst of this
      darkness, a sudden light broke
      in upon me -- a light so brilliant
      and wondrous, and yet so simple!'

  The CAMERA has reached Freddy.  His eyes are burning; he
  reads almost feverishly.  Inga and Igor are half asleep.

          FREDDY
        (reading)
      'Change the poles from plus to
      minus and from minus to plus!'

  Freddy howls insanely.

          FREDDY
        (reading)
      'I alone succeeded in discovering
      the cause of generation of life.'

  He doubles over in laughter.

          FREDDY
      'Nay, even more -- I, myself
      became capable of bestowing
      animation upon lifeless matter.'

  He laughs, he laughs, he laughs... then SMASHES his tea
  glass against a wall.

  A work space has been hastily prepared.  Freddy, dressed
  quite properly in riding boots and tweed jacket, is
  reading from "the great book".

  Inga, dressed in her Lab gown, is taking notes.  Igor is
  drawing on a large pad.

          FREDDY
      'As the minuteness of the parts
      formed a great hindrance to my

          INGA
      His schwanzstucker.

          IGOR
      Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.

          FREDDY
      Now then!  What we're aiming
      for, is a being about eight
      feet in height, and all features
      proportionably large.

  Igor shows his drawing.

          IGOR
      Something like this?

  They all look at the drawing.

  They, and we, SEE a crude but impressive sketch of THE
  MONSTER, and as we look at the drawing:

        (o.s.)
      You've caught something there.
      Yes!  As a matter of fact --

  A gigantic BODY is standing on a scaffold.  when we reach
  the head, it is somehow incongruous:  A sweet, boyish face
  -- with a rope around its neck.

  The "Body" is about to be hanged.  next to it stands an
  EXECUTIONER.

          EXECUTIONER
      Have anything to say?

          THE BODY
        (in quiet anger)
      MMmmmgrrrrrrrrr!

          EXECUTIONER
      Anything else?

  The "Body" thinks.  Then:

          THE BODY
      Go shove it up your --

  The Executioner throws the lever and THE TRAP DOOR FALLS
  OPEN.

  The "Body" hangs, lifeless.

  Through an iron gate surrounding the cemetery, TWO DARK
  FIGURES peek through the rails and observe the funeral.
  (One of them has a hunched back)

  SOFT MOANING is HEARD from one of the Relatives.  A MINISTER
  mumbles Latin under his breath.

  The Pallbearers set the coffin down on ropes placed over
  the gravesite.  A short distance away are a FATHER and a
  MOTHER, standing next to a weeping DAUGHTER.

          FATHER
      He was a good man.

          MOTHER
      He was an angel.

          FATHER
      He was a saint!

  A pause.

          MOTHER
      She had to marry this rotten
      pig instead.

          FATHER
      Hanging was too good -- they
      should have soaked him in lye.

  The minister nods and TWO GRAVE DIGGERS lower the coffin.
  The Daughter throws a bouquet of flowers onto the descending
  coffin.  The Minister throws a handful on dirt on top of
  the coffin -- representing "Ashes to Ashes."

  Freddy and Igor are just setting the heavy coffin down
  on an operating table.  they take the lid off the hinges
  and set it aside.

          FREDDY
      Wait!  Let's tip the coffin
      over, then just lift it off.
      It'll be much easier.

  They tip the coffin over, upside down, like a cake pan.

          FREDDY

  They lift the coffin up... but the operating table remains
  empty.

          FREDDY
      Set it down!

  They set it down on the table again.  Freddy gives the
  bottom of the coffin (which is now on top), a big WHACK!
  They lift the coffin up again and there is the "Body."
  It had been struck.

          FREDDY
        (looking at the
        "Body")
      Magnificent!

  He checks its nails.

          FREDDY
      Very little decay.  With this
      magnificent specimen for a
      body, all we need now is an
      equally magnificent brain.
        (he looks
        at Igor)
      You know what to do!

          IGOR
      I have a pretty good idea.

  Igor glances at the movie audience for a moment.

      Do you have the name I wrote
      down?

          IGOR
        (looking at
        his sleeve)
      Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.

          FREDDY
      I want that brain.

          IGOR
      Was he any good?

          FREDDY
      Was he any good???  He was the
      finest natural philosopher,
      internal medicine diagnostician
      and chemical therapist of this
      century.

      Hmm!

          FREDDY
      And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.

          IGOR
      That's not bad.

          FREDDY
      Can you imagine that brain in
      this body?

          IGOR
      I'm getting excited just thinking
      about it.  What if he's not there?

          FREDDY
      He only died two weeks ago --
      I'm sure they'll still have him.
      Hurry now.  I'll prepare the
      body.

          IGOR
        (starting to leave)
      Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?

          FREDDY
      Why?

          IGOR
      It's always been one of my
      favorite names.

          FREDDY
      If you like -- just hurry!

          IGOR
      Thank you, Master.

  Freddy rolls up the "Body's" right sleeve.  He gazes at
  the immensity of the hand in amazement and awe.

          FREDDY
      Look at this hand!  Look at
      these fingers!

  A sudden thought twists through his brain.  He sets the
  dead arm up on its elbow, intertwines his own right hand
  with that of the "Body's," and gets set for an "Indian
  Arm Wrestle."

  Freddy forces the dead arm down -- not without some difficulty
  -- and then gives the "Body" a triumphant sneer.

  LOW THUNDER!

  A row of brains in jars, under glass domes, rests on a long,
  narrow table.

  Igor tiptoes slowly, examining the labels on each glass dome
  that he passes.

  ALBERTUS MAGNUS   CORNELIUS AGRIPPA   LAWRENCE TALBOT
    (Physicist)   (Natural Philosopher) (Hematologist)

  Then he comes to:

  HANS DELBRUCK
  (Scientist & Saint)

  Igor approaches the glass dome, lifts it off, and takes the
  jar containing the brain of Hans Delbruck.

  As he turns to go, he sees himself in a Full-length mirror.
  He drops the jar in fright.

  He looks down and sees the gooks mass of brain and glass.

  He looks at the Movie Audience.

          IGOR
      Funny thing is... I tried!

  He sweeps some of the mess under the table with his foot.

          IGOR

      Freud would have a heyday with
      this.  Well...

  Freddy, wearing a long, white surgeon's gown and surgical
  mask, stands over the "Body," which is strapped across the
  chest and thighs.  Freddy has a thimble on the finger of
  one hand -- a needle and thread in the other.

          FREDDY
      Finished!

  The "Body" is on an operating table, which is in the center
  of a platform directly below the opening in the ceiling.
  Inga stands nearby.

          INGA
      What a beautiful job!

  Freddy looks up to the opening in the ceiling.

  Freddy hands Inga the needle and thread.  Then he grabs
  an electrical plug, connected to a "battery indicator,"
  and plugs it into two small slits in one of the electrodes
  in the "Body's" throat... as you would plug in a lamp.  He
  reads the indicator.

          INGA
      Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

  She turns a giant wheel on the wall.  The platform rises
  towards the opening in the ceiling, with Freddy and the
  "Body" on ,it.

          FREDDY
        (as he is going up)
      The ancient masters promised
      impossibilities and performed
      nothing.  We shall penetrate into
      the recesses of nature.  We shall
      ascend into the Heavens.  We shall
      command the thunders of Heaven,
      mimic the earthquake and even mock

      Yes!  When I give the word -- throw

      You've got it, master.

  The platform rises higher and higher.  RAIN starts to come
  down on Freddy.

          FREDDY
      Get ready!

  The platform nears the opening.

          FREDDY
      Get set!

  Inga turns the giant wheel the other way.

  Igor throws back the three switches.

  THE LIGHTS RETURN TO NORMAL.

  Inga and Igor watch Freddy and the platform descend.

  When it reaches the floor, Freddy stands soaked to the skin.
  ALL EYES ARE ON THE "BODY."

          FREDDY
      Nothing!

  They all stare at:

  THE FROZEN FACE of the "Body."

86  INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT              86

  Freddy, Inga and Igor sit at a long dining room table, set
  with food and wine.  Freddy stares into space.

      Reputation.  Reputation!

          INGA
      I thought it was wonderful.

          FREDDY
      I don't understand -- I followed
      the notes to the letter.

      But there must be a reason.
      This is science, not art.

          INGA

  Igor looks at Inga, then passes the meat.

  The FROZEN FACE is still frozen.  The chest is not breathing.
  The arm is motionless.

  The FINGERS......... MOVE!

88  DINING ROOM                 88

          FREDDY
      Let's look once more.  I can't
      stand just sitting here doing
      nothing.  Maybe we left to soon.

  Freddy and Igor set up.  Inga goes on eating.

                    CUT TO:

89  THE LABORATORY                89

  Freddy and Igor walk into the Laboratory and stand next to
  the "Body."

          FREDDY
      Cold!  Cold and dead!

          IGOR
      You mustn't take it so hard.

  Freddy leans his head down, in anguish, and rests it on
  the chest of the "Body."

  The "Body's" FINGER pushes against Freddy's behind.  Igor
  doesn't see it.

          FREDDY
        (to Igor)
      Don't try to cheer me up that way.

          IGOR
      Well, I don't like to see you mope.

  Igor stands next to Freddy.

          IGOR
      You'll be getting me sad next.

          FREDDY
      I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take
      out my frustration on you.  You've
      been a great help to me, and I've
      let you down.

  The "Finger" rubs against Igor's behind.

          IGOR
        (looking up suddenly)
      I'm not that sort you know.  I
      appreciate you feelings, but try
      to show them some other way.

          FREDDY
        (lifting his head)
      You're right!  Self-pity never
      got anyone anywhere.  Let's go
      back and finish our dinner.

  They leave.

  The "Finger" OPENS AND CLOSES ITS HAND.

                    CUT TO:

90  DINING ROOM                 90

  Inga, Igor and Freddy are eating dessert.

          IGOR
      What is this?

      Schwartzwalder Kirschtorte.

  Seeping in from the laboratory, we HEAR: "MMMMMMmmmmmm!"

          FREDDY
        (to Igor)
      Oh, do you like it?  I'm not
      partial to desserts, but this
      is excellent.

          IGOR
      Who are you talking to?

          FREDDY
      To you!  You just made a 'yummy'
      sound, so I thought you liked the
      dessert.

          IGOR
      I didn't make a 'yummy' sound --
      I just asked what it was.

          FREDDY
      But you did -- I just heard
      it.

          IGOR
      It wasn't me.

  Freddy looks at Inga.

          INGA
      It wasn't me.

          FREDDY
      Look here -  if it wasn't you,
      and it wasn't you, and it wasn't
      me...

  Their eyeballs meet in the center of the room.  then they
  all tear downstairs to the Laboratory.

91  INT. LABORATORY               91

  They burst into the room.  What we may at last call THE
  MONSTER is straining, tentatively, against the straps
  across his chest and thighs.  his head is raised.

          MONSTER
      MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

          FREDDY
      It's alive!

          INGA
      Oh, Doctor!

          INGA
      I think you've done it, master.

          FREDDY
      Alive!  Look at it.  I have
      defeated death!

          IGOR
      Better not get too close, master.
      This guy could kill you.

          FREDDY
      I suppose you're right.  Inga!
      Prepare a sedative, just in
      case.

  Inga goes to a medicine case and prepares a hypodermic.
  The Monster raises its head and makes little circles with
  its hands, asking to be "free."

          FREDDY
      It's trying to talk.  it wants
      us to take off the straps.

          IGOR
      Don't fall for that one.

          FREDDY
      But don't you see...the brain
      of Hans Delbruck is inside this
      grotesque hulk -- pleading with
      us.  I've got to untie it.

          IGOR
      careful, master -- you never can
      tell with these chaps.

                    Cont.

                      91 Cont.

          FREDDY
      All right...stand back!

  Freddy carefully walks up to the Monster and stands over
  him.  The monster is silent, feeling his way.

          FREDDY
      Hello there.

          MONSTER
      MMMMMmmmmmmm.

          FREDDY
      How's everything?

          MONSTER
        (just a suggestion
        of "not so good")
      MMMmmmmmmmm.

          FREDDY
      I'm going to untie you -- can
      you understand that?

          MONSTER
        (a soft, "crying"
        SOUND)
      MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

          FREDDY
      Yes, I'm going to set you free.
        (to Inga)
      Is the sedative ready?

          INGA
      Yes, Doctor.

  Freddy takes the strap across the Monster's thighs and
  unties it.  Then he unties the strap across its chest...
  and steps back.  ALL EYES ARE ON THE MONSTER.  TINGLY
  MUSIC.  The Monster looks at them all for a moment while
  he is still lying down.  A slightly sly grin comes to his
  mouth.  He rises...slowly, carefully, to a sitting position.

          MONSTER
        (a low, suspicious
        groan)
      MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm.

          FREDDY
      It's alive.  It's -- moving!
      It's -- breathing!  It's --
      standing!  What is your name?

          MONSTER
        (thinking for
        a moment)
      ... It's.

          IGOR
      Original.

          FREDDY
        (holding out
        his hands)
      Give -- me -- your -- hand!

  The Monster slowly extends his hands to Freddy.  Freddy
  takes them and leads the Monster into his first steps.

92  PRODUCTION NUMBER - "ALIVE"           92

  ... in which Freddy, the Monster and Igor do a SONG and
  DANCE that teaches the Monster how to move.  Occasionally,
  Inga and an unseen FIFTY-PIECE ORCHESTRA join in.  The
  Monster tries, in his own special way, to imitate the
  gentle, "Soft Shoe" examples of Freddy and Igor.  But
  where they "Ping" and "Clink" ... he "PONGS" and "CLONGS."

93  ANOTHER ANGLE               93

  After a big finish, the Monster beams ecstatically.  he
  bows out of instinct:  "Show Business" is in his blood.

          FREDDY
      Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

          IGOR
      You can say that again.

          FREDDY
      Yes.

          IGOR
      You're just supposed to repeat
      what you said.

          FREDDY
      Why?

      What's the point of my setup?
      It's not funny unless you repeat
      exactly what you said.

          FREDDY
      I'm not trying to be funny.

  Igor looks at the Movie Audience.

          IGOR
      Repeat it anyway -- it's a
      wonderful cue.

          FREDDY
      ... I'm glad that's...

          IGOR
      No, no!  That whole thing!

          FREDDY
      ... Whew!  I'm glad that's
      over with.

          MONSTER
      MMMMmmmmmmmmm!

  They all look at the Monster.

          IGOR
      See what I mean?

  Freddy gives Igor a dirty look.

          MONSTER
        (signifying "More!")
      MMMmmm!  MMMmmm!

          INGA
      I think 'It' wants to do it
      again Doctor.

          FREDDY
      It looks that way.

      Oh...let's do it a little more.

94  ANOTHER ANGLE               94

  They all SING and DANCE a short encore of "ALIVE."  The
  Monster gets violently carried away in his search for
  dance perfection.

95  ANOTHER ANGLE               95

  Freddy, Igor and Inga drop from exhaustion after another,
  even bigger ORCHESTRAL finish.  The Monster immediately
  asks for:

          MONSTER
      MMMmmm!

  They all stare at him in horror.

          MONSTER
        (signifying "More")
      MMMMmmmmm!  MMMMmmmmm!

  Freddy walks boldly up to the Monster.

          FREDDY
      Stop that!  Now just stop that
      this instant and listen to me!

  The Monster stares at Freddy in fascination.

          FREDDY
      I have given you one of the
      finest minds of this century.
      You are a brilliant endocrinologist.
      You are a superb scientist.  And
      you are making naughty!  Now that's
      enough.  Finished!  From now on,
      you will behave like a man, and
      not a spoiled, snot-nosed, sniveling
      brat who thinks he can get anything
      he wants by bullying people with
      sheer brute force.

  The Monster gives Freddy a W H A C K you wouldn't believe
  unless you were there.  Inga SCREAMS.

          IGOR
      This fellow's got great timing.

  The Monster picks Freddy up in his two hands and then
  holds him high over his head.

          INGA
      Oh, Doctor -- be careful!

  The Monster is about to dash Freddy to pieces, when:
  MUSIC:  A VIOLIN is HEARD PLAYING the EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN
  LULLABY.  The monster FREEZES -- still holding Freddy over
  his head.

          MONSTER
        (soft, pathetic
        cries)
      Mmmmmm!  Mmmmmm!

          INGA
      Doctor! There's that strange
      music again.  what could it be?

          IGOR
      It seem to have stopped the
      big fellow in his tracks.

          FREDDY
        (from over the
        Monster's head)
      Ayegor!  Find out where that
      music is coming from as quietly
      and as blindingly fast as you can.

          IGOR
      Yes, Master!

          FREDDY
      Act casual!

  Igor casually takes out a box of jujubees from his pocket
  and eats one.  He walks over to the Monster, who is still
  holding Freddy over his head.

          IGOR
        (to the Monster)
    Care for a jujubee?

  The Monster lowers one hand -- holding Freddy up with the
  other -- and takes the box of jujubees.  He sniffs them.

          FREDDY
      Clever ploy!

  The Monster drains the box of jujubees in one gulp, then
  hands the empty box back to Igor.

          IGOR
        (looking at the
        empty box)
      NO movies together for us --
      that's for sure.

  Igor MOVES OFF in search of the MUSIC.  The Monster --
  deeply affected by the LULLABY -- slowly sets Freddy
  down.

          INGA
      It's almost as if he were
      afraid.  he loves that music.

  The Monster begins to hug Freddy and snuggle him.  he
  behaves like a frightened, loving child, as he holds his
  arms out to Freddy.

          INGA
      I think he wants you to carry
      him, Doctor.

  Freddy nods agreement.

          INGA
      What are you going to do?

          FREDDY
      I think I'll...carry him.

  Freddy prepares to lift the Monster.  Suddenly:  THE
  MUSIC STOPS!  The Monster's eyeballs float menacingly
  towards Freddy.

          MONSTER
      MMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

          INGA
      Doctor!  The music has stopped.

  The Monster's hands creep around Freddy's neck.

          FREDDY
      Do you think you can sing it?

          INGA
      Me?  Sing?

  The Monster is really choking Freddy now.

          INGA
      I'd be so nervous.

          FREDDY
      This is not the finals -- just
      sing!

          INGA
        (singing)
      It's some-thing dar-ing,
      'The Con-ti-nen-tal,'
      A way of danc-ing
      that's real-ly ul-tra new;
      It's ver-y sub-tle,
      'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'

  The Monster is temporarily distracted.  then he gives
  Inga an angry look.  The is not the music that he wants.

          INGA
        (singing)
      Be-cause it does what
      you want it to do.

          MONSTER
      MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

  The Monster's hands tighten around Freddy's neck.

          INGA
        (singing)
      It has a pas-sion,
      'The Con-ti nen-tal...'

          FREDDY
      Stop -- singing!!!

  Igor WALKS IN, holding a violin and bow.  He sees the
  Monster choking Freddy.

          IGOR
      How's it going?

          FREDDY
      What did you find out?

          IGOR
      Someone was playing this in
      the music room.

      How do you know it was a 'he'?

          FREDDY
      All right -- where is she?

          IGOR
      How do you know it was a 'she'?

          FREDDY
        (gasping his
        last breath)
      Bring -- me -- the -- violin!

          IGOR
      Can you play it?

          FREDDY
      Maybe...if you get here on time.

  Igor goes to Freddy and hands him the violin and bow.
  Freddy plays the TRANSYLVANIA LULLABY to the best of
  his ability.  The Monster's hands begin to loosen.

          INGA
      It's working!  Oh, Doctor --
      you play beautifully.

          IGOR
      Do you know the theme from
      'Doctor Zhivago'?

          FREDDY
      Get the sedative ready!

          MONSTER
        (soft and loving)
      MMmmm!  MMmmm!

  The Monster hugs Freddy's face.  Freddy, still playing
  the violin, pats the operating table for the Monster to
  "lie down."  He does -- holding onto Freddy's face.

          INGA
      I think he wants to be tucked in.

          FREDDY
      Get a blanket from under that
      shelf!

  Inga gets the blanket.  The Monster holds Freddy's head
  onto his chest, as Freddy continues playing.  Inga and
  Igor spread the blanket over the operating table, then
  gently tuck the Monster in "bed."  The Monster pulls
  Freddy into bed with him and snuggles against Freddy's
  shoulder.  Freddy continues playing the violin under the
  covers.

          FREDDY
        (to Inga)
      All right -- give it to him!

          INGA
      Are you serious??

          FREDDY
      Give him the sedative!

          INGA
      Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

  She prepares the hypodermic, then lifts up a small section
  of the blanket -- AWAY FROM OUR VIEW -- and pulls down the
  Monster's pants a short way.

          IGOR
      He's got quite a tush.

  She puts the needle in.

          FREDDY
      Did you do it?

          INGA
      I think so.

          FREDDY
      Good!  It shouldn't take more
      than a few seconds.

  Freddy gradually stops playing.

      Why don't we all turn in?  It's
      been a long day.

          FREDDY
      Wait -- I'm sure he's out by now.
      That shot was strong enough to stop a horse.

  Freddy gradually stops playing.  One of the Monster's
  hands sleepily closes around Freddy's throat.

      See you at breakfast, then!

  Freddy continues playing.

        (as he plays
        the violin)
      This song.  This haunting melody.
      This ancient, quaintly atonal
      folk tune...is driving -- me --
      crackers!  I can't go on -- do
      you understand??  Can NOT go on
      playing this pathogenically rotten
      song.  If you're not asleep yet,
      then kill me if you have to, but
      at the count of three...I stop!
      One!................ Incidentally,
      I was thinking of making a big
      breakfast tomorrow -- blueberry
      waffles and crisp bacon.  Two!...
      ...................... By the
      way, I'm sorry I yelled at you
      before -- I must have been over-
      tired.  Anyway, I meant to apologize
      and just forgot.  Two!...............
      Maybe tomorrow would be a good day
      just to relax -- go for a swim,
      maybe do a little water skiing.
      Well...we'll see after we finish
      a nice breakfast.  Three!

  Freddy stops playing.  the monster is sound asleep.
  Freddy puts the violin down, throws off the blanket,
  then ties the straps that bind the  Monster to the
  operating table.

          FREDDY
        (when the Monster
        is firmly tied)
      Spoiled Sissy!

  Freddy picks up the violin again and stares at it.

          FREDDY
      The song is over!

  He looks at the sleeping Monster.

          FREDDY

  He breaks the violin in half.  Immediately, he feels a
  sense of relief and lightheadedness.

      Oh!  Oh my!  What a strange

      I felt such a pressure, splitting
      my head apart.  I feel so relieved
      and lightheaded.  That horrible
      pressure...like voices...all calling
      to me, imploring me...swearing at me.
      Well, it's over now, thank goodness.

        the Monster)
      Oh...my poor Doctor Delbruck.

        Monster's head)
      Doctor, Doctor...what have I done
      to you?  Was habe ich von Dir
      gamacht?  Your magnificent brain,
      locked in this...pile of... Forgive
      me, Doctor.  I thought -- for science
      only.  I couldn't stand the thought
      to mankind.  I was a fool!  How
      dangerous is the acquirement of
      knowledge, and how much happier
      is that man who believes his native
      town to be the world, than he who
      aspires to become greater than his
      nature will allow.  Con you ever
      forgive me?

  He puts his head down in silent prayer.  MUSIC:  ANOTHER

  body tenses.  We cannot see his face, but his fingers go
  to his temples.  He slowly raises his head.

      That's a knockout tune!  That tune
      is a winner.  You can't call it
      'wishy-washy' ... like some people
      I know.  That song is going places.

  The Monster is at the warmup bar, doing ballet exercises
  to the MUSIC OF CHOPIN -- which is being PLAYED on the
  PIANO by Igor.

  Inga -- also in leotards -- is at the bar in front of the
  Monster, so that he may follow her example.

  Freddy sits on a chair in the middle of the floor,
  pounding out the "count" with a long stick.

          FREDDY
      And one and two and three and four

          FREDDY
      And oopy, not so hasty, please,
      and stretch your legs
      and lift your knees.

  The monster, involuntarily, continues his footwork while
  he is trying to choke Freddy.

  Freddy picks up a violin from under his chair and plays
  the EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY -- BUT IN THE SAME RHYTHM
  THEY HAVE BEEN USING, so that not a "count" is missed.

          FREDDY
      And even though we're nose to nose,
      Always, always point your toes!

      Don't knot your fists like monsters do,
      but light-ly, gently, pas de deux.

      A grateful bot who has a chance
      would never kill if he could dance.

      So take your fingers off my throat
      and two -- remove them from my chest

      and three and two, continue please;
      I didn't say 'It's time to rest.'

      Don't stand flat footed; point your toes!
      Don't hang your hands like some dumb clod;

      Always lift them gracefully,
      like little chil-dren praying to God.

      That's the way an angel grows
      but first he learns to POINT his TOES!

  Igor continues playing Chopin.  The Monster goes back to
  his exercises.

  He lightly ripples the strings:  his face lights up!

  He ripples the strings a second time:  he is in ecstasy.

  Freddy, Igor and Inga watch with great expectation.

  The Monster lifts the Ballerina up, and sets her down.
  He lifts her up, and sets her down.

  Now he takes her hand, prepares for the "big Twirl,"

      And now, my fellow scientists and
      neurosurgeon...I must ask you to
      ...suspend belief.
      For up until now, you have seen the
      Creature perform the simple mechanics
      of motor activity.  That this Creature
      was an inanimate blob, which I endowed
      with the secret of life -- yes!...in
      all honesty -- that showed some measure
      of skill on my part.
      But for what you are about to see
      next...we must enter -- quietly --
      into the realm of genius.  I say
      this modestly, only because I am,
      myself, as in awe of the gifts I
      possess as if I were observing them
      in some other person.  I think of
      them, only, as a loan.  Grateful, of
      course...that my credit is good.
      Thus, with the accumulated knowledge
      of Chemistry, Electricity, Neuro-
      surgery...and art...I now present
      what was once an inarticulate mass
      of lifeless tissues.
      Ladies and gentlemen...
      Mesdames et Messieurs...
      Damen und Herren...The Creature!

115 INT. RECEPTION HALL             115

  The front door opens and Elizabeth comes in.  Frau Blucher
  and a COACHMAN can be SEEN in the b.g.

  Freddy stands in dressing gown and ascot.  Inga and Igor
  wait politely in the rear.

          ELIZABETH
      Darling!

          FREDDY
      Darling!

  They embrace.

          ELIZABETH
      Surprised?

          FREDDY
      Surprised!

          ELIZABETH
      Love me?

          FREDDY
      Love you! ...Well, why don't
      we turn in?

                    Cont.

          ELIZABETH
      Darling!?!

          FREDDY
      I mean, it's been a long day.
      I'm sure you must be as tired
      as I am.  Oh!  These are my
      assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.

  Freddy turns to get some luggage from the Coachman.

          ELIZABETH
        (stepping up
        to Inga)
      How do you do?

          INGA
      Very well.  So nice to meet you
      at last.

  Elizabeth steps up to Igor.

          IGOR
      Darling!

          ELIZABETH
      Hello...?

          IGOR
      Surprised?

          ELIZABETH
      Well... yes.

          IGOR
      Miss me?

          ELIZABETH
      I...

  Freddy approaches them with Elizabeth's two suitcases:
  One very large, and one very small.

          FREDDY
      Ready, darling?

          ELIZABETH
      Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.

          FREDDY
        (to Igor)
      Give me a hand with these, will
      you, Ayegor?

                    Cont.

                      115 Cont.1

          IGOR
      Certainly, master.

  Igor takes the small suitcase, and, with Inga, leads
  Elizabeth and Freddy up the stairs.  Freddy struggles with
  the large suitcase.  Frau Blucher follows behind.

115A  ON THE STAIRWAY               115A

          ELIZABETH
      What a strange fellow.

          FREDDY
      Yes, he's a little bit... tilted.
      Harmless, though.

          ELIZABETH
      Why does he call you 'master'?

  Freddy stares at her.

          FREDDY
      Are you suggesting I call him
      master???

          ELIZABETH
      No, of course not.  I just meant...

          FREDDY
      All right then!

116 INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - NIGHT           116

  The Monster walks in cautiously.  No one seems to take
  any particular notice of him.

  He walks up to the MAITRE D' and taps his back.

          MAITRE D'
      Yes, sir, name, please?

          MONSTER
      Food!

          MAITRE D'

      Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have
      a reservation you can skip to
      ma-loo.

  The Monster grabs the Maitre D' by the lapels

          MONSTER
      Foooooood!

          MAITRE D'
      Now just one moment.  There's no
      need for roughhousing.  Have you
      ever tried a tip?

          MONSTER
      GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!

          MAITRE D'
      Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!

117 NEW ANGLE                 117

  The Monster attacks the restaurant.  LADIES, GENTLEMEN

  PANDEMONIUM.

118 INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT          118

  Elizabeth -- in a long, satin robe -- stands over Freddy,
  who sits staring into a fire.

          FREDDY
      Poor Delbruck!  There must be
      some way to reach him -- to
      control that body.

          ELIZABETH
      Darling, you mustn't worry so.

                    Cont.

                      118 Cont.

          FREDDY
      But there's a genius inside that
      body -- crying out for love and
      understanding and normal human
      relationships.  I just have to
      find some way to re-establish his
      communications system.

          ELIZABETH
      But you can't do that at night.
      And even if you could -- it would
      cost a fortune.  Come to bed,
      darling.

          FREDDY
      Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will
      dien tachlas von Dir?

          ELIZABETH
      You've done everything that's
      humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh,
      darling, I'm so worried about you
      -- you need rest.

          FREDDY
      I suppose you're right.

          ELIZABETH
      Of course I am.  Now come along
      like a good boy.

  He gets up.

          FREDDY
      What would I do without you?

  They kiss.

          ELIZABETH
      Is your room just down the hall?
      ... in case I get frightened
      during the night?

          FREDDY
      Yes, but... I thought, perhaps
      tonight, under the circumstances,
      I might... stay here with you.

          ELIZABETH
      Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil
      everything.

          FREDDY
      I don't want to spoil anything --
      I just want to top it all off.

          ELIZABETH
      Would you want me, now, like this,
      so soon before our wedding? ...
      So near we can almost touch it?
      Or wait a little while longer,
      when I can give myself without
      hesitation?... When I can be
      totally and unashamedly yours??

          FREDDY
      That's a tough choice.

          ELIZABETH
      Is it worth taking a chance?

          FREDDY
      I suppose you're right.

          ELIZABETH
      Of course I am.  Now give me
      a kiss and say good night like
      my good boy.

  They kiss.

          FREDDY
      Good night.

          ELIZABETH
      That's my good boy.

  Freddy steps out into the:

119 INT. HALLWAY                  119

  Elizabeth blows him a kiss and slowly closes her door.

  Freddy stands for a moment, then walks to the door next
  to Elizabeth's room and knocks.

120 ANGLE ON INGA               120

  She is wearing a flimsy nightgown, opens the door.

          INGA
      Why, Doctor... is anything the
      matter?

          FREDDY
      Just passing through the night.

          INGA
      What's wrong, Doctor?  You
      seem... lonely.

          FREDDY
      Oh, a little.  But it's not just
      physical loneliness.  It's the
      pangs that come from missing
      someone intellectually... as I
      have you.

          INGA
      I've missed you intellectually,
      too, Doctor.

  He stares at her almost "see-through" nightgown.

          FREDDY
      It's terrible -- the price society
      demands in the name of fidelity...
      ultimately?

          INGA
      Not fooling around.

          FREDDY
      I know, but I mean -- not fooling
      around physically?... Or not
      fooling around intellectually?

          INGA
      I see what you mean.

          FREDDY
      There can never... ever... be
      anything physical between us.
      You know that, dear.

          INGA
      I know Frederick.

  He is staring at her breasts.

          FREDDY
      It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.

          INGA
      Of course not.

                      120 Cont.1

          FREDDY
      For that matter, it wouldn't
      be fair to you, or to me.

  On the word "you", he touches Inga's breast to emphasize
  his point.  On the word "me", he touches his own chest.

  Pause.

          INGA
      What?

          FREDDY
      I say, it wouldn't be fair to
      you... or to me.

          INGA
      Nor to Elizabeth.

          FREDDY
      No.  Nor to Elizabeth.

          INGA
      We all have our feelings.  I
      know that I have mine.  And...
      I wouldn't want to hurt yours.

  On the word "mine", she touches her chest for emphasis.  On
  the word "yours", she places her hand on Freddy's chest
  and rubs it a little.

          FREDDY
      Yes, I do have my feelings.  And,
      of course, you have yours.

  He rubs her chest.

          INGA
      And Elizabeth has hers.

          FREDDY
      Yes, Elizabeth has hers.

          INGA
      But, after all, you have yours.

  She unbuttons a button of his pajama top so that she can
  touch his chest better.

          FREDDY
      Yes, I have mine.

          INGA
      And I have mine.

      Why don't we talk inside?

          FREDDY
        (keeping one
        hand on her chest)
      Well...
        (he looks at
        his watch)
        ... perhaps for a few minutes.

  They go into Inga's room.

121 EXT. BURGOMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT           121

  VILLAGERS, with torches and DOGS, stand on the street, in
  front of the Burgomeister's steps.

          FIRST VILLAGER
      Burgomeister Krempen.

          SECOND VILLAGER
      Burgomeister Krempen!

          THIRD VILLAGER
        (pounding on the door)
      Burgomeister Krempen!

          FOURTH VILLAGER
      Mayor Krempen!

          BURGOMEISTER
        (opening the door)
      What is it?  What's going on?

          FIRST VILLAGER
      The monster, sir.  The Monster is
      loose.

          BURGOMEISTER
      Do you realize it's after eight
      o'clock???

          SECOND VILLAGER
      Yes, sir, but the monster.  He's
      escaped!

          THIRD VILLAGER
      He's running through the countryside,
      terrorizing the villagers.  No one
      is safe.

          BURGOMEISTER
      What do you mean 'the' monster --
      as if this happened every Sunday.
      You mean 'a' monster.

          FOURTH VILLAGER
      No, sir, it's 'the' monster.  The
      Frankenstein monster.

          BURGOMEISTER
      Oh, Tommy Rot!

          ASSORTED VILLAGERS
      Yes!
      Frankenstein!
      The Frankenstein monster!

          BURGOMEISTER
      Now wait a minute!  Just wait a
      minute!

  They quiet down.

          BURGOMEISTER
      Now see here!  There'll be no more
      wild accusations bandied about
      while I'm still Burgomeister of
      this village.  If there is mischief
      afoot, the way to find out is to
      confront the man with the charges
      brought against him.  It's the
      only decent thing to do.  And as
      long as I'm Burgomeister of your
      village -- a man's name is still
      his honor.

          FIRST VILLAGER
      But it's true, sir.  Young Master
      Freddy -- he's come from America
      and read all of his grandfather's
      secret notes.  They've started the
      whole business all over again, sir.

          BURGOMEISTER
      That swine!

          SECOND VILLAGER
      It's in the blood, sir.  The whole
      family is insane.

          THIRD VILLAGER
      He's got to be put away.

          FOURTH VILLAGER
      And the monster destroyed!

          ASSORTED VILLAGERS
      Yes!
      The monster!
      Kill the monster!
      The monster must be destroyed!

          BURGOMEISTER
      Now see here!  Before we go running
      about, killing people, we'd better
      make damned sure of our facts.  A
      riot is an ugly thing... and once
      you get one started -- there's
      little chance of stopping it short
      of bloodshed.

  "Groans" of disappointment from assorted Villagers.

          BURGOMEISTER
      So the first thing we'll do, is
      march calmly up to the Frankenstein
      castle and have a nice little chat
      with our good doctor.  Now then!
      Who doesn't have a torch and a dog?
      All right -- follow me!

          ASSORTED VILLAGERS
      Yay!
      Down with Frankenstein!
      Kill the monster!

  They all run off ahead of the Burgomeister.

          FREDDY
      You've got to help me to remain
      faithful.

          INGA
      Yes, I will.

          FREDDY
      ...But an intellectual relationship,

  Elizabeth is just finished brushing her hair, humming
  quietly to herself.  She stands up and blows out the
  candles near her mirror.

  She walks to some French doors that open onto a small
  balcony.  She opens the glass doors and looks at:

  Bright and full.

  She takes a breath of fresh air, then closes the doors
  and walks to her large double bed.  She slips off her
  robe -- revealing her thin body in delicate nightgown.
  Suddenly she hears:

  "MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm."

  She turns towards the French doors and listens.  She
  decides that it was nothing and gets into bed.

  fireplace.

  There is the soft SOUND of CURTAINS FLAPPING.

  The French doors have been opened -- the silk curtains
  flapping from a breeze outside.

129 EXT. CASTLE                 129

  Finally the door opens and Freddy appears in his robe.  he
  looks at the angry mob.

          BURGOMEISTER
      Frederick Frankenstein?

          FREDDY
      You have the wrong house.

          BURGOMEISTER
      And who might you be?

          FREDDY
      Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

          BURGOMEISTER
      The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?

          FREDDY
      No!

          BURGOMEISTER
      What was your grandfather's name?

      Forgive me for intruding so late
      at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly
      rumor has it that there are strange
      goings on in this castle.  These
      good citizens are ready to rip you
      from limb to limb unless you can
      offer some rational explanation for
      their fears.  How say you?

          FREDDY
      Ugly, vicious rumous.

  A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM!

          assorted villagers
      What was that?
      Listen!
      Did you hear that?

          BURGOMEISTER
      They say, also, that you have
      recreated the horrible monster
      who, for so many years, has haunted
      and terrorized the God-fearing
      people of this village.  What say
      you to that?

          FREDDY
      Poppycock!

  Igor comes running out from inside the castle.

          IGOR
      He's back!  He's back!  The

      What monster?

          IGOR
      What d'ya mean "What monster?'
      You remember...the one we madein
      the basement.

  Everyone looks at Freddy

          FREDDY
      I think we all need a good night's
      sleep.  Why don't we meet next week
      and thrash this thing out?

          BURGOMEISTER
      Now wait a minute!

          IGOR
      You don't understand, Master.
      The big fellow's broken in and
      kidnapped your fiancee.

          FREDDY
      What???

          IGOR
      He's carrying her off now through
      the woods.

  Freddy, the Burgomeister and Igor run around to the side of
  the castle.  The Villagers follow.

132 EXT. SIDE OF CASTLE             132

  The Monster can just be SEEN, far below, disappearing into
  the woods (SEVEN TREES AND A BACKDROP).  Elizabeth is slung
  over his back.

          ASSORTED VILLAGERS
      There he is!  That's the monster!
      After him!
      Kill him!

  The Burgomeister and all the Villagers run off after the
  Monster, leaving Freddy an Igor alone.

      No!  The only hope now is to get

      a way to relieve the pressure on
      his cerebellum...

          IGOR
      That sound good, boss.

          FREDDY
      ... and equalize the imbalance
      in his cerebrospinal fluid...

          IGOR
      I like your style, master.  How
      do we get him here?

          FREDDY
      There's only one way.

      I'll bet it's a doozy.

  The Burgomeister is being pulled along by a GREAT DANE.

134 THE VILLAGERS               134

  climb little hills and rocks.  OTHER DOGS are BARKING
  ferociously.

          BURGOMEISTER

  The Burgomeister's Great Dane is making so much noise, it's
  difficult to hear.

          1ST VILLAGER
      What?

          BURGOMEISTER
      There he is!!

          1ST VILLAGER

  The Burgomeister gives his leash a yank and the Great Dane

  Several Villagers look up and then start SHOOTING at a
  TALL VILLAGER, who is peeing on top of a distant rock.  He
  has his back turned to the other Villagers.

          TALL VILLAGER

135 INT. CAVE - NIGHT               135

  The Monster enters the cave slightly out of breath and stands
  the "fainted" Elizabeth on her feet.

  He shakes her.

          MONSTER
      MMmmm.

  He shakes her again.

          MONSTER
      MMmmm!

  Elizabeth slowly opens her eyes.

  The Monster smiles sweetly.

  Elizabeth smiles sweetly in return -- forgetting for a moment
  where she is.  Then her smile turns to growing horror.  She
  starts to scream, but the Monster quickly covers her mouth.

  After a moment, the Monster tries to make a "Shhhh" sound
  with his finger, but as he releases her mouth to use his
  "Shhh" finger... her SCREAM is still going on.

  He covers her mouth again and shakes her.

          MONSTER
      MMMmmmm!

  He gradually takes his hand from her mouth.

  She is silent;  but her eyes are filled with terror.

  The Monster starts to unbutton his pants.

      Baack!

  She moves back a foot.

          MONSTER
      Morrr!

  She moves back another foot... fascinated.

  We cannot see what she sees, but what ever it is...she is
  suddenly filled with awe.

          ELIZABETH
      Oh my goodness!  Nineteen if it's

  The Monster's eyes twinkle lasciviously.

          ELIZABETH
      You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?

          MONSTER
      MMMmmmm.

          ELIZABETH
      All right then... seven's always
      been my lucky number.

  They are about to kiss, when suddenly the Monster's ears
  perk up as he hears:

  MUSIC:  THE EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LILLABY

  He doesn't know where it is coming from.

          ELIZABETH
      What, dear?  What is it?

  The Monster gives a pathetic little cry.

          MONSTER
      MMMmm!

          ELIZABETH
      Is it that music?

          MONSTER
      MMMMM!  MMMMM!

          ELIZABETH
      Probably just some nearby cottage.
      Nothing to worry about.

  The Monster gets up and starts out of the cave... pulled by
  forces he doesn't understand.

      Where are you going?  They've
      left their F-M station on, that's

  In front of him is a tall microphone on a stand, with two
  enormous speakers nearby, facing the woods.

  Igor sits on a chair, near Freddy, like a member of a band
  waiting for his cue.

  just the "bridge."  When he is finished, he sits back down

      And who are you, sir, that you
      order these people about?

          MONSTER
      I am a relative of the doctor's.  I
      came to visit him a few weeks ago,
      in hopes that this distinguished
      member of my family might be able
      to help me with a problem that I've
      had since birth...and which has
      caused more sorrow in my heart than
      I wish on any man.

          ASSORTED VILLAGERS
        (whispering)
      What'd he say?
      Relative??

          MONSTER
      You see, because of my great size
      and the somewhat unusual features
      of my head -- when women look at me,
      their first impulse is to scream;
      children often cry, or vomit; and
      men are inclined to beat me over
      the head.

  The Laboratory is silent.

          MONSTER
      I lived in hopes of meeting people
      who would..overlook my outward
      appearance and respect me for
      whatever good qualities I had to
      offer.  If anyone had ever shown a
      little kindness, I would have
      returned it, I think, at least
      one hundred times over.
      And for that one person's sake...
      I would have made piece with the
      whole world.
      Do you understand what it means --
      never to see a kind or happy face?
      You could imagine then, perhaps, how
      such bitterness led me, at last, to
      the brink of another kind or life.
      I decided that if I couldn't inspire
      love...which was my deepest hope...
      I would, instead...cause fear.

  A quiet shudder runs through the Villagers.

      But all of that happened to me a
      lifetime ago.  And I paid for my
      crimes...severely.  It was just
      then that fate, or chance, brought
      me to our famous doctor.
      I found this man to be vain; I found
      him to be driven with ambitions of
      personal glory, and consumed with an
      unquenchable thirst for power.  But
      even at the height of his quest --
      this ego-driven, brilliant and half-
      crazed scientist..always...always
      ...held an image of me as something
      beautiful.
      And then, at the moment of truth,
      when it would have been easy enough
      to run and stay out of danger...he
      used himself as a guinea pig, in
      order to give me a calmer brain...
      and a slightly more eloquent way
      of speaking.
      Yes!  I am 'The Monster"...sometimes
      known as 'Him,' or occasionally,
      'The Creature.'  But they're one and
      the same.  I am that tall, peculiarly
      attractive stranger, with the winning
      smile.
      Would you all get the hell out of here!

170 THE VILLAGERS               170

  mumble and shuffle out of the laboratory.

          INGA
      Oh, 'It's'...you were wonderful.
      But I'm so worried about the doctor.

  Igor is listening to Freddy's heartbeat, as Inga and the
  Monster come to him.

  They all three put their ears to Freddy's chest and
  listen.

  They smile.

172 INT. MODERN BEDROOM - NIGHT           172

  Elizabeth is sitting at her makeup table, dressed in a
  nightgown, getting ready for bed.

          ELIZABETH
      Darling!  I hope you didn't find
      Daddy's little party too boring.
      He did it just for you, and he
      meant well.  Tell me you
      liked it.

          A VOICE

      MMmmm.

          ELIZABETH'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      I know Mummy's just a scatterbrain
      without a serious thought in her
      head, but...you lover her just a
      little bit, don't you?

          A VOICE
        (o.s.)
      MMmmm.

          ELIZABETH'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      I'm ready for bed, sweetheart.
      Almost done??

  The bathroom door opens and the Monster steps out.  He
  is dressed in elegant silk pajamas and a handsome robe.

          MONSTER
      MMmmm.

  Even though his electrodes still stick out from his neck,
  he appears well-groomed.  Elizabeth gets into bed and
  waits for him.

      Did you see?...I put a special

      your shirts.  the other one is
      just for socks and poo-poo undies.

          MONSTER
        (as he takes off
        his robe)
      MMmmm.

  He gets into bead and turns out the table lamp.

          ELIZABETH
      Still happy you married me?

          MONSTER
      MMmmm.

          ELIZABETH
      Love me oodles and oodles?

          MONSTER
      MMmmm.

          ELIZABETH
      So this is what it's like to be
      completely happy!

174 INT. CASTLE BEDROOM - NIGHT           174

  Freddy is sitting in an easy chair near the fire, dressed
  in pajamas and reading a newspaper.  (Probably the
  Transylvania Tribune -- International Edition).

  From the bathroom comes the SOUND of Inga, HUMING a
  pleasant tune to herself.

          INGA'S VOICE
        (o.s., from the
        bathroom)
      Did you have a nice day today?

          FREDDY
      Oh, just the usual:  sore throats,
      a few colds.  Someone who thought
      he was a wearwolf, and two bladder
      transplants.

                    Cont.

                      115

                      174 Cont.

  She goes on humming.

          INGA'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      Did you notice the new drapes I put
      up in the bedroom?

          FREDDY
        (looking up)
      Yes!...They're very nice.

          INGA'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      Oh, I'm glad.

  A short pause of silence, and then Inga begins humming
  the EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY, quietly unconsciously.

  Freddy's face is hidden behind the newspaper, but he is
  suddenly completely motionless.

          INGA'S VOICE
        (o.s.)
      I was hoping you'd like them.

  She continues humming the Lullaby.

  Freddy lowly lowers the newspaper.

  He touches his fingertips to his temple.  His eyes open
  and close, as if he were trying to focus.

  Inga comes out of the bathroom, dressed in her nightgown,
  and folds back the covers of their large double bed.
  She continues humming.

          INGA
      All right if I turn out the lamp,
      sweetheart?

          FREDDY
        (answering)
      MMmmm.

  She turns out the lamp as she goes on humming.  The bedroom
  is lit only by moonlight and the glow from the fireplace.

          INGA
        (as she is arranging
        the pillows)
      Shall I set the alarm?

                    Cont.

                      174 Cont.1

          FREDDY
      MMMmmm.

  She goes on humming, as she pulls out the stopper on the
  alarm clock.  Freddy rises.  his arms hang away from his
  body, STIFFLY.  He walks in fits and jerks.

          FREDDY
      MMMMmmmmm!

          INGA
      Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So!
      I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

  Freddy is standing at the edge of the bed.

          INGA
      Are you ready for me?

          FREDDY
      MMMMmmmmm!

          INGA
      Ready for Fuchsmachen???

          FREDDY
      MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!

          INGA
      I love it when you're excited.  Come
      then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my
      arms and let me hold you.

  Freddy kneels onto the bed.

  A long pause.

          INGA
      Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

          FREDDY
      MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

                    CUT TO:

175 TURRET AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE           175

  Igor sits in the window, blowing his trumpet.

167 ANOTHER ANGLE               176

  PULL BACK SLOWLY, until the whole castle in SEEN.

                    FADE OUT

          THE END
