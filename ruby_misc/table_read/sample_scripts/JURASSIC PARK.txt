1 EXT JUNGLE  NIGHT

  An eyeball, big, yellowish, distinctly inhuman, stares raptly
  between wooden slats, part of a large crate.  The eye darts from side
  to side, alert as hell.

  A legend tries to place us - -

  ISLA NUBLAR
  120 MILES WEST OF COSTA RICA

  - - but to us it's still the middle of nowhere.

  It's quiet for a second.  A ROAR rises up from the jungle,
  deafening.  The trees shake as something very, very large plows ahead
  through them, right at us.  Every head gathered in this little clearing
  snaps, turning in the direction of the sound as it bursts through the
  trees.

  It's a bulldozer.  It drops its scoop and pushes forward into
  the back end of the crate, shoving it across the jungle floor towards
  an impressive fenced structure that towers over an enclosed section of
  thick jungle.  There's a guard tower at one end of this holding open
  that makes it look like San Quentin.

  The bulldozer pushes forward into the back end, the crate THUDS
  TO THE FLOOR.  A door slides open in the pen, making a space as big as
  the end of the crate.

  Nobody moves for a second,  A grim-faced guy who seems to be in
  charge (Robert Muldoon, although we don't know it yet).

        MULDOON
    Alright now, pushers move in.  Loading team move it.

  The movement as agitated whatever is inside the crate, and the
  whole thing shivers as GROWLS and SNAPS come from inside.
  Everyone moves back.

        MULDOON (cont'd)
    Alright, steady.  Get back in there now, push.  Get back
    in there,  Don't let her know you're afraid!

  The men go back to the crate and begin to push it into the slot.
  The crate THUDS UP AGAINST THE OPENING.  A green light on the side of
  the pen lights up, showing contact has been made.

  FROM INSIDE THE CRATE,
  we get glimpses of what's on the other side of those wooden
  slates - - jungle foliage, MEN with rifles, searching searchlights.
  The view is herky-jerky as the crate put into position.

        MULDOON
    Well locked� Loading team, step away.  Joffrey, raise
    the gate.

  A WORKER climbs to the top of the crate.  The search lights are
  trained on the door.

  The RIFFLEMEN throw the bolts on their rifles and CRACK their
  stun guns, sending arcs of current CRACKING through the air.

  The WORKER gets ready to grab the gate when all at once - -

  A ROAR from the inside the crate, and the panel flies out of his
  hands and SMACKS into him, knocking him clear off the crate.

  Now everything happens at once.  The WORKER THUDS to the jungle
  floor, the crate jerks away from the mouth of the holding pen flash, an
  alarm BUZZER sounds - -

  - - and a claw SLASHES out from inside the crate.  It sinks into
  the ankle of the WORKER. dragging him toward the dark mouth between the
  crate and the pen.  The WORKER SCREAMS and paws the dirt, leaving long
  claw marks as he is rapidly dragged toward the crate.

  Muldoon SHOUTS orders:

        MULDOON
  Tasers get in there, Goddamn it!

  They FIRE their guns - the wood of the crate SPLINTERS.

  Muldoon runs in and grabs the WORKER, trying to pull him free.

  The wild arcs of currents from the stun gun flash and CRACK all
  around, but in a second - -

  - - the WORKER is gone.

  CUT TO:

2   EXT MOUNTAINSIDE  DAY

  MANO DE DIOS AMBER MINE
  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

  DONALD GENNARO, forty, in a city man's idea of hiking clothes
  and a hundred dollar haircut, approaches on a raft being pulled across
  a river by TWO MEN.

  On the hillside, JUAN ROSTAGNO, thirty-ish, Costa Rican, a
  smart-looking guy in workers clothes, is waiting for him.

        ROSTAGNO
    Tengo mil pesos que dicen que se cae
      (I have a thousand pesos that say he falls)
      (or)
    Apuesto mil pesos que se cae.
      (I bet a thousand pesos he falls)

  Gennaro finally lands, and Rostagno helps him off the raft.

        GENNARO
    Hola, Juanito

        ROSTAGNO
    Hola, bienvenido

  Rostagno leads Gennaro towards the mine.  Dozen of shirtless
  WORKERS claw and SCRAPE at a rocky mountainside that is the site of an
  extensive mining operation.  The work is all done by hand, pick and
  shovel instead of dynamite and bulldozer.

        GENNARO
    What's this I hear at the airport� Hammond's not even
    here?

        ROSTAGNO
    He sends his apologies.

        GENNARO
    You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million
    lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't
    even be bothered to see me?

        ROSTAGNO
    He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's
    getting a divorce.

        GENNARO
    I understand that.
      (or)
    I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal
    with this situation now.  The insurance company - -

  Gennaro almost falls, Rostagno helps him.

        GENNARO (cont'd)
    - -the underwriters of the park feel the accident raises
    some very serious questions about the safety of the park, and they're
    making the investors very anxious.  I had to promise I would conduct a
    thorough on-site inspection.

        ROSTAGNO
    Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.

        GENNARO
    Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really
    slow things down.
      (or)
    If they pull the funding that's going to slow things
    down around here.

  A WORKER hurries up to them and busts into the conversation,
  breathless.

        WORKER
      (to Rostagno)
    Jefe, encontramos otro mosquito, en el mismo sitio.
      (Chief, we found another mosquito in the same place)

        ROSTAGNO
    Seguro? Muestrame!
      (Are you sure? Show me.)

  The WORKER and ROSTAGNO scramble back deeper into the mine.
  Rostagno calls back over his shoulder to Gennaro.

        ROSTAGNO (cont'd)
    It seems like it's going to be a good day after all.
    They found another one! C'mon.

  Gennaro struggles to keep up.


3   EXT CAVE  DAY


  ROSTAGNO and GENNARO move into the dark, dripping cave, where at
  least a dozen other WORKERS are gathered in a tight circle, staring at
  something intently.

  Rostagno fights his way to the center of the group.  One of the
  WORKERS hands him something and Rostagno examines it carefully.

  It's a chuck of amber, a shiny yellow rock about the size of a
  half dollar.
  GENNARO
  If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance
  guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too
  trendy.  They want Alan Grant.

        ROSTAGNO
    Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.

        GENNARO
    Why not?

        ROSTAGNO
    Because he's like me.  He's a digger.

  Rostagno turns and holds the amber up to the sunlight streaming
  through the mouth of the cave.

  With the light pouring through it, the amber is translucent, and
  we can see something inside this strange stone - -

  - - a huge mosquito, long dead, entombed there.

        ROSTAGNO
      (smiles)
    Hay que lindo eres vas hacer a much gente feliz.
      (Oh you're so beautiful.  You will make a lot of
      people happy)


  CUT TO:


5   EXT THE DIG DAY

  An artist's camel hair brush carefully sweeps away sand and rock
  to slowly reveal the dark curve of a fossil - it's a claw.  A dentist's
  pick gently lifts it from the place its has laid for millions of years.
  Pull up to reveal a group of diggers working on a large skeleton.  All
  we see are the tops of their hats.  The paleontologist working on the
  claw lays it in his hand.

        GRANT
      (thoughtfully)
    Four complete skeletons. . . .
    such a small area. . .
    the same time horizon - -

        ELLIE
    They died together?

        GRANT
    The taphonomy sure looks that way.

        ELLIE
    If they died together, they lived together.
    Suggests some kind of social order.

  DR ALAN GRANT, mid-thirties, a ragged-looking guy with intense
  concentration you wouldn't want to get in the way of, carefully
  examines a claw.

  DR ELLIE SATTLER, working with him, leans in close and studies
  it too.  She paints the exposed bone with rubber cement.  Ellie in her
  late twenties, athletic-looking.  There's an impatience about Ellie, as
  if nothing in life happens quite fast enough for her.

  Her face is almost pressed up against his, she's sitting so
  close.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    They hunted as a team.  The dismembered tenontosaurus
    bone over there - that's lunch.  But what killed our
    raptors in a lakebed, in a bunch like this?  We better
    come up with something that makes sense.

        ELLIE
    A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -

        GRANT
      (excited)
    That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up
    puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking
    good.

  From the bottom of the hill a voice SHOUTS to them:

        VOLUNTERR (o.s.)
    Dr Grant!  Dr Sattler!  We're ready to try again!

  Grant SIGNS and sits up, stretching out his back.

        GRANT
    I hate computers.

  He shoves the claw absent-mindedly into his pocket and he and
  Ellie walk toward the source of the voice.  As they walk, we get our
  first look at the badlands.  Exposed outcroppings of crumbling
  limestone stretch for miles in every direction, not a tree or a bush in
  sight.

  In the dig itself, the ground is checkered with excavations
  everywhere.  There's a base camp with five or six teepees, a flapping
  mess tent, a few cards, a flatbed truck with wrapped fossils loaded on
  it, and a mobile home.  There are a dozen VOLUNTEERS of all ages at
  work in various places around the dig.  The Volunteers are from all
  walks of life, dinosaur buffs.  Three or four of them have CHILDREN
  with them, and the kids run around, like in a giant sandbox.

  Grant , Ellie and a Volunteer walk down the hill. Grant spots a
  KID kicking dirt onto one of the digs.  He notices and frowns.

        GRANT
    What's that kid doing?
      (to the kid)
    What are you doing there!? Excuse me!  Can you just back
    off?  This is very fragile!  Are you out of your mind?
    Get off that and go find your parents!
      (to Ellie)
    Did you see what he just did?

  The kid stomps away, pissed off.

        KID
    Asshole.

        GRANT
      (to Ellie)
    Why do they have to bring their kids?!

        ELLIE
    You could hire your help.  But there's four summers of
    work here, with the money for one.  And you say it's a
    learning experience, sort of a vacation, and you get
    volunteers with kids.

  He and Ellie arrive to where several VOLUNTEERS are clustered
  around a computer terminal that's set up on a table in a small tent,
  its flaps lashed open.

        GRANT
      (to the Volunteer)
    Ready to give it a shot, Jerry?

  A LITTLE GIRL moves a little too close to the machine.

        ELLIE
    Want to watch the computer?

  Ellie quietly moves her out of Grant's way, to a place she can
  see.

        VOLUNTEER
    Thumper ready?

        MAN
    Ready.

        VOLUNTEER
    Fire.

  The VOLUNTEER throws a switch on a machine that looks a bit like
  a floor buffer.  The whole thing hops up into the air as it drives a
  soft lead pellet into the earth with a tremendous force.  There is a
  dull THUD, the earth seems to vibrate, and all eyes turn to the
  computer screen - -

        ELLIE
    How long does this usually take?

        VOLUNTEER
    It should be immediate return.  You shoot the radar into
    the ground, the bone bounces back....

    The screen suddenly comes alive, yellow contour lines tracing
    across it in three waves, detailing a dinosaur skeleton.

        VOLUNTEER
    This new program's incredible!  A few more years of
    development and you don't have to dig any more!

  Grant looks at him, and his expression is positively wounded.

        GRANT
    Well, where's the fun in that?

        VOLUNTEER
    It looks a little distorted, but I don't think that's
    the computer.

        ELLIE
      (shakes her head)
    Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.
      (to Grant)
    Velociraptor?

        GRANT
    Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm
    guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -

  He points to part of the skeleton, but when his finger touches
  the screen the computer BEEPS at him and the image changes.  He pulls
  his hand back, as if it shocked him.

        VOLUNTEER
    What's you do?

        ELLIE
    He touched it.  Dr. Grant is not machine compatible.

        GRANT
    They've got it in for me.

  The Volunteer LAUGHS and touches a different part of the screen,
  which brings the original image back.  Grant continues, but doesn't get
  as close.

        GRANT
    Look at the half-moon shaped bone in the wrist.  No
    wonder these guys learned to fly.

  The group laughs.  Grant is surprised.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Now, seriously.  Show of the hands.  How many of you
    have read my book?

  Everyone stops laughing and looks away.  Ellie raises her hand
  supportively.  So does the Volunteer, Grant sighs.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Great.  Well maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
    present-day birds than reptiles.  Look at the public
    bone - - it's turned backwards, just like a bird.  The
    vertebrae - - full of hollows and air sacs, just like a
    bird.  Even the word raptor means "bird of prey".

  The kid steps forward and looks at the computer skeleton
  critically.

        KID
    That doesn't look very scary.  More like a six-foot
    turkey.

  Everyone sort of draws in their breath and steps aside,
  revealing the KID, standing alone.  Grant turns to the Kid, lowers his
  sunglasses, and stares at him like he just came from another planet.

  Grant strolls over to the KID , puts his arms around his
  shoulders in a friendly way.

        GRANT
    Try to imagine yourself in the Jurassic Period.
      (or)
    Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period.

  Ellie rolls her eyes.

        ELLIE
      (under her breath)
    Here we go.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    You'd get your first look at the six-foot turkey as you
    move into a clearing.  But raptor, he knew you were
    there a long time ago.  He moves like a bird; lightly,
    bobbing his head, And you keep still, because you think
    maybe his visual acuity's based on movement, like a T-
    rex, and he'll lose you if you don't move.  But no.  Not
    VELOCIRAPTOR.  You stare at him, and he just stares
    back.  That's when the attack comes - - not from the
    front, no, from the side, from the other two raptors you
    didn't even know were there.

  Grant walks around the Kid.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see, he uses
    coordinated attack patterns, and  he's out in force
    today.  And he slashes at you with this - -

  He takes the claw from his pocket and holds it at the front of
  the raptor's three-toed foot.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    - - a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the
    middle toe.  They don't bother to bite the jugular, like
    a lion, they just slash here, here - -

  He points to the Kid's chest and thigh.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    - - or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines.
    Point is, you're alive when they start to eat you.
    Whole thing took about four seconds.

  The Kid is on the verge if tears.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    So, you know, try to show a little respect.

  And with that he walks back across the camp, returning to his
  skeleton.  Ellie hurries to catch up with him.

        ELLIE
    You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you
    could've just pulled a gun on him.

        GRANT
    Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of
    those?

        ELLIE
    Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at
    some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with
    kids?

        GRANT
    Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're
    sticky, they're expensive.

        ELLIE
    Cheap, cheap, cheap.

        GRANT
    They smell.

        ELLIE
    Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.

        GRANT
    They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.

        ELLIE
    Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but
    usually babies don't smell.

        GRANT
    They know very little about the Jurassic Period they
    know less about the Cretaceous.

        ELLIE
    The what?

        GRANT
    The Cretaceous.

        ELLIE
    Anything else, you old fossil?

        GRANT
    Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!

        ELLIE
    It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to
    strangle you right now!

  Ellie playfully takes Grant's hat off and gives him a tight hug.
  They kiss.

  A strange wind seems to be whipping up.  Grant and Ellie look
  around, confused.  The wind is getting stronger, blowing dirt and sand
  everywhere, filling in everything they've dug out, blowing the
  protective canvasses off.  Now there's a more familiar ROAR, and they
  look up and see it - -

  - - a huge helicopter, descending on the camp.

        ELLIE
      (to the volunteers)
    Get some canvasses and cover anything that's exposed!

  Grant's already on it, trying to desperately to protect the
  skeleton he's excavating.  He looks up at the helicopter and SHOUTS,
  shaking his fist.


  CUT TO:


9   EXT BASE CAMP DAY

  Down at the base camp, the helicopter has landed.  The PILOT is
  already out, waiting as GRANT comes down from the mountaintop like
  Moses steaming.  Grant gestures wildly at him to turn the chopper off.

  The pilot points timidly to a mobile home across the camp.
  Grant runs to the trailer.


10  EXT TRAILER DAY

  The door to the trailer SLAPS open, and GRANT storms in.

        GRANT
    What the hell do you think you're doing in here?

  The trailer serves as the dig's office.  There are several long
  wooden tables set up, every inch covered with bone specimens that are
  neatly laid out, tagged, and labeled.

  Farther along are ceramic dishes and crocks, soaking other bones
  in acid and vinegar.

  There's old dusty furniture at one end of the trailer, and a
  refrigerator.  A man roots around in the refrigerator, his back to us.
  GRUMBLING about the contents which are mostly beer.

  His hand falls across a bottle of expensive champagne in the
  back.

        MAN
    Ah hah!

  He pulls it out - the cork POPS.

  The Man turns around.  JOHN HAMMOND, seventy-ish, is sprightly
  as hell, with bright, shining eyes that say "Follow me!"

  Grant stares incredulously at the Man, holding his champagne
  bottle without an invitation.

        GRANT
    Hey, we were saving that!

        HAMMOND
    For today, I guarantee it.

        GRANT
    And who in God's name do you think you are....?

        HAMMOND
    John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you
    in person Dr Grant.

  Grant is struck silent.  He shakes his hand, staring dumbly.

        GRANT
    Mr. - - Hammond?

  Hammond looks around the trailer approvingly, at the enormous
  amount of work the bones represent.

        HAMMOND
    I can see my fifty thousand a year as been well spent.

  The door SLAPS open again and ELLIE comes in, just as pissed off
  as Grant was.

        ELLIE
    Okay, who's the jerk?

        GRANT
    Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

        ELLIE
    Sattler.

        Grant
    Dr Sattler.  Ellie, this is Mr. HAMMOND.
      (in case she didn't catch it)
    John Hammond.

        ELLIE
    Did I say jerk?

        HAMMOND
    I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry.
    Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?

  Hammond begins to walk into the kitchen, making himself at home.
  Ellie follows him tries to help.  Grant settles behind the table.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Come along then, don't let it get warm!
      (expansively)
    Come on in, both of you.  Sit down.

  As Hammond moves, they notice he walks with a slight limp and
  uses a cane - - for balance or style, it's hard to say witch.

        ELLIE
    I have samples all over the kitchen.
      (she takes some stones out of one of the glasses)

        HAMMOND
    Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come
    along.

  Ellie goes around towards Grant.  She grabs a bottle of water.
  They look at each other, really aback by this guy's bravado, and site
  down.  Hammond dries the glasses.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Well now, I'll get right to the point.  I like you.
    Both of you.  I can tell instantly with people; it's a gift.
      (new subject)
    I own an island.  Off the coast of Costa Rica.  I leased
    it from the government and spent the last five years setting up a kind
    of biological preserve down there.  Really spectacular.  Spared no
    expense.  It makes the one I had in Kenya look like a petting zoo.  No
    doubt that sooner or later our attractions will send (drive the) kids
    right out of their minds.

        GRANT
    And what are those?

        ELLIE
    Small versions of adults, honey.

  He gives her a dirty look.

        HAMMOND
    Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open
    next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't
    care for lawyers.  You?

        GRANT
    I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -

        HAMMOND
    Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble
    in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they
    insist on outside opinions.

        GRANT
    What kind of opinions?

        HAMMOND
    Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face
    it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If
    I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you
    know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on
    schedule - -
      (he Americanizes him pronunciation)
    - -schedule.

        ELLIE
    Why would they care what we think?

        GRANT
    What kind of park is it?

        HAMMOND
      (smiles)
    Well, it's - - right up your alley.
      (hands Grant a drink)
    Look, why don't you both (the pair of you) come on down
    for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a
    paleobotoanist as well.
      (hands Ellie a drink)
    I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
      (he jumps up and sites on the counter)

        GRANT
    No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just
    discovered a new skeleton, and - -

        HAMMOND
      (pours himself a drink)
    I could compensate you by fully funding your dig

        GRANT
    - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -

        HAMMOND
    For a further three years.

  Grant OOFS as Ellie elbows him hard in the ribs.

        ELLIE
    Where's the plane?


  CUT TO:

11  EXT CAFE  DAY

  DENNIS NEDRY is in his late thirties, a big guy with a constant
  smile that could either be laughing with you or at you, you can never
  tell.  He sits at a table in front of a Central American cafe, eating
  breakfast

  Another Legend:
  SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA

  Nedry looks up and sees a man get out of a taxi - - LEWIS
  (Louis) DODGSON, fiftyish, wearing a large straw hat and looking almost
  too much like an American tourist.  Dodgson clutches as attach� case
  close to him and scans the cafe furtively.
  Nedry laughs, shakes his head, and waves to him.

        NEDRY
    Dodgson!

  Dodgson hurries over to the table.

        DODGSON
      (as he sites)
    You shouldn't use my name.

        NEDRY
    Dodgson, Dodgson.
      (loud)
    We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat.
    What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?

  Dodgson ignores that, sets his attach� case down next to the
  table, and slides it towards Nedry,

        DODGSON
    Seven fifty.

  Nedry smiles and pulls the attach� closer to him.

        DODGSON (cont'd)
    On delivery, fifty thousand more for ever viable embryo.
    That's one point five million.  If you get all fifteen
    species off the island.

        NEDRY
    Oh, I'll get 'em all.

        DODGSON
    Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if
    they don't survive.

        NEDRY
    How am I supposed to transport them?

  Dodgson pulls an ordinary can of shaving cream from a shoulder
  bag he carries and sets it on the table.

        DODGSON
    The bottom screws open; it's cooled and
    compartmentalized inside.  They can even check it if
    they want.  Press the top.

  Nedry presses the top of the can and real shaving cream comes
  out.  He grins, impressed.  While Dodgson talks, Nedry looks around for
  somewhere to wipe the shaving cream and ends up dumping it on top of
  someone's Jell-O on a dessert tray next to him.

        DODGSON (cont'd)
    There's enough coolant gas for thirty-six hours.

  Nedry looks at the can.

        NEDRY
    What?  No menthol?

        DODGSON
    Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here
    in San Jose by then.

        NEDRY
    That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock
    tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it
    right.

        DODGSON
    I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the
    security?

        NEDRY
    I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and
    your company catches up on ten years of research.

  A WAITER arrives and puts the check down on the table, between
  them.  Nedry looks down at it pointedly, then up at Dodgson.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Don't get cheep on me Dodgson.

  Dodgson rolls his eyes and picks up the check.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    That was Hammond's mistake.



13  EXT OPEN SEA  DAY

  A helicopter, "IN-GEN CONSTRUCTION" emblazoned on the side,
  skims low over the shimmering Pacific.


14  EXT HELICOPTER  DAY

  GRANT, ELLIE, GENNARO and MALCOLM are huddled in the back of the
  chopper; HAMMOND is in the front with the PILOT.

  There are two other passengers was well -- DONALD GENNARO, the
  lawyer from the amber mine, now dressed in safari clothes, everything
  straight from Banana Republic.  The other Dr. IAN MALCOLM, fortyish,
  dressed all in black, with a snakeskin boots and sunglasses.  Malcolm,
  who finds it hard to take his eyes off Ellie, leans over and SHOUTS
  over the engine whine.

        MALCOLM
    So you two dig up dinosaurs?

        GRANT
    Try to!

  Malcolm laughs, finding this very amusing, which confuses Grant.
  Hammond turns around annoyed.

        HAMMOND
    You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from
    a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a
    mathematician!

        MALCOLM
    Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!

  Hammond SNORTS, not even bothering to cover his contempt for
  Malcolm.

        MALCOLM
    John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it
    has to say about his little science project!

        HAMMOND
    Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining
    these concerns of yours about this island!

        MALCOLM
    I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the
    behavior of the system in phase space!

  Hammond just waves him off.

        HAMMOND
    A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that�s all it is!

        MALCOLM
      (poking at Hammond's knee)
    John, John.

        HAMMOND
      (pushing him away)
    Don't do that!

        MALCOLM
    Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?

        ELLIE
      (shaking  her head)
    No.

        MALCOLM
    No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?
      (again, she shrugs)
    Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not
    familiar with the concept of attraction!

  Grant just rolls his eyes as Malcolm gives her an oily grin, but
  Ellie smiles, enjoying Grant's jealousy.  Hammond turns to Gennaro and
  gives him a dirty look.

        HAMMOND
    I bring scientists -- you bring a rock star.

  Hammond looks out the windshield, and CLAPS his hands excitedly.

        HAMMOND
    There it is!

  Up ahead, the others see it.

  ISLA NUBLAR.  It's a smallish island, completely ringed by thick
  clouds that give it a lush, mysterious feel.  The PILOT pulls up over a
  spot in the clouds and starts to descend, fast.

      HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Bad wind shears!  We have to drop pretty fast!  Hold on,
    this can be a little thrilling!

  The helicopter drops like a stone.  Outside the windows, they
  can see cliff walls racing by, uncomfortably close.  They bounce like
  hell, hitting wind up and down drafts.

  Only Hammond still feels chatty.

      HAMMOND (cont'd)
    We're planning an airstrip!  On pilings, extending out
    into the ocean twelve thousand feet!    Like La Guardia,
    only a lot safer!  What do you think?

  They don't answer, just hold on.  As they near the ground, a
  luminous white cloud cross appears below them, a landing pad shining
  through the Plexiglas bubble in the floor of the chopper.

  The cross grows rapidly larger as the chopper plummets, but a
  sudden updraft catches them and they bounce skyward for a moment then
  drop again, even faster if possible, before landing with a hard BUMP.


14A   EXT HELICOPTER LANDING PAD  DAY

  The chopper plummets and finally lands.  One of the workers
  opens the door and the group gets out.  Hammond looks out, proudly.


15  EXT HILLTOP DAY

  Two large, open-top jeeps ROAR down the hilltop away from the
  landing cross as the helicopter engines WHINE back to life and the
  rotors start to spin again.

  ELLIE, GRANT, and MALCOLM hold on tight in the front jeep,
  HAMMOND and GENNARO are in the rear jeep.  Both cars have DRIVERS.

  They pass through an enormous gate in a thirty foot high fence,
  which is closed behind them by two PARK ATTENDANTS.

  There are large electrical insulators on the fences, warning
  lights that strobe importantly and clear signs -- "ELECTRIFIED FENCE!
  10,000 VOLTS!"

  IN THE REAR JEEP,

  Gennaro regards the fences critically.

        GENNARO
    The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?

        HAMMOND
    And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking
    systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy
    yourself.

        GENNARO
    Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a
    weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of
    the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I
    represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from
    now, if they - -
      (gestures to Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm)
    - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut
    you down John.

        HAMMOND
    Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your
    apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!

  He shoves Gennaro aside, to get a clear view of Grant, Ellie,
  and Malcolm.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    I wouldn't miss this for the world.

  The jeeps wind their way along a mountain road.

  IN THE LEAD JEEP,

  Ellie stares off to the right, fascinated by the thick tropical
  plant life around them.  She tilts her head, as if something's wrong
  with this picture.

  She reaches out and grabs hold of a leafy branch as they drive
  by, TEARING it from the tree.

  IN THE REAR JEPP,

  Hammond watching Grant, signals to his Driver .

        HAMMOND
    Just stop here, stop here.  Slow, slow.

  He slows down, then stops.  So does the front jeep.

  IN THE FRONT JEEP,

  Ellie stares at the leaf, amazed, running her hand lightly over
  it.

        ELLIE
    Alan - -

  But Grant's not paying attention.  He's staring too, out the
  other side of the jeep.

  Grant notices that several of the tree trunks are leafless -
  just as thick as the other trees, but gray and bare.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
      (still staring at the leaf)
    This shouldn't be here.

  Grant twists in his seat as the jeep stops and looks at one of
  the gray tree trunks.  Riveted, he slowly stands up in his seat, as if
  to get closer.  He moves to the top of the seat, practically on his
  tiptoes.

  He raises his head, looking up the length of the trunk.  He
  looks higher.

  And higher.

  And higher.

  That's no tree trunk.  That's a leg.  Grant's jaw drops, his
  head falls all the way back, and he looks even higher, above the tree
  line.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
      (still looking at the leaf)
    This species of vermiform was been extinct since the
    cretaceous period.  This thing - -

  Grant, never tearing his eyes from the brachiosaur, reaches over
  and grabs Ellie's head, turning it to face the animal.

  She sees it, and drops the leaf.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    Oh - - my - - God.

  Grant lets out a long, sharp, HAH - a combination laugh and
  shout of joy.

  He gets out of the jeep, and Ellie follows.  Grant points to the
  thing and manages to put together his first words since its appearance:

        GRANT
    THAT'S A DINOSAUR!

  - - a dinosaur.  Chewing the branches.  Technically, it's a
  brachiosaur, of the sauropod family, but we've always called it
  brontosaurus.  It CRUCHES the branch in its mouth, which is some
  thirty-five feet up off the ground, at the end of its long, arching
  neck.  It stares down at the people in the car with a pleasant, stupid
  gaze.

  Ellie looks up at the sauropods in wonder.

  They've pretty light on their feet - a far cry from the
  sluggish, lumbering brutes we would have expected.

  Hammond gets out of his jeep and comes back to join them.  He
  looks like a proud parent showing off the kid.

  Ian Malcolm looks at Hammond, amazed, and with an expression
  that is a mixture of admiration and rapprochement.

        MALCOLM
    You did it.  You crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

  Grant and Ellie continue walking, following the dinosaur.

        GRANT
    The movement!

        ELLIE
    The - - agility.  You're right!

  In their amazement, Grant and Ellie talk right over each other.

        GRANT
    Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness.
    It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded
    creature.  They're totally wrong.

        ELLIE
    They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live
    in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!

  Several of the top branches are suddenly RIPPED away.  Another
  sauropod, reaching for a branch high above their heads, stands
  effortlessly on its hind legs.

        GRANT
      (to Hammond)
    That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot
    neck?

        HAMMOND
    The brachiosaur?  Thirty.

    Grant and Ellie continue to walk.

        GRANT
    - - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it
    can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and
    get around like that?!  Like that!?
      (to Hammond)
    This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.

        HAMMOND
      (proudly)
    We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.

        ELLIE
    You've got a T-rex!?
      (to Grant)
    He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -

        GRANT
    Say again?

        HAMMOND
    Yes, we have a T-rex.

  Grant feels faint.  He sits down on the ground.

        ELLIE
    Honey, put your head between your knees, and breathe.

  Hammond walks in front of them and looks out.

        HAMMOND
    Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler.  Welcome to Jurassic
    Park.

  They turn and look at the view again.  It's beautiful vista,
  reminiscent of an African plain.  A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the
  plain, maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone.

        GRANT
    Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds.
    They do move in herds!

        ELLIE
    We were right!

        GRANT
      (to Hammond)
    How did you do it?!
      (or)
    How did you do this?!

        HAMMOND
    I'll show you.

  Finally, we notice Gennaro, who was sort of faded into the
  background while the others reacted.  He's just staring, a look of
  absolute rapture on his face.

  He speaks in a voice that is hushed and reverent.

        GENNARO
    We are going to make a fortune with this place.

16  OMITTED


17  EXT MAIN COMPOUND DAY


  The main of Jurassic Park is a large area with three main
  structures connected by walkways and surrounded by two impressive
  fences, the outer fence almost twenty feet high.

  Outside the fences, the jungle has been encouraged to grow
  naturally.

  The largest building is the visitor's center, several stories
  tall, its walls still skeletal, unfinished.  There's a huge glass
  rotunda in the center.

  The second building looks like a private residence, a compound
  unto itself, with smoked windows and its own perimeter fence.

  The third structure isn't really a building at all, but the
  impressive cage we saw earlier, overgrown inside with thick jungle
  foliage.  The jeeps pull up in front of the visitor's center.


A18   EXT VISITOR'S CENTER  DAY

  HAMMOND leads GRANT, ELLIE, GENNARO, and MALCOLM up the stairs,
  talking as he goes,  Two ladies open the doors to the Visitor Center.


18  INT VISITOR'S CENTER  DAY

  The lobby of the still-unfinished visitor's center is a high-
  ceilinged place, and has to be house its central feature, a large
  skeleton of a tyrannosaur that is attacking  bellowing sauropod.
  WORKMEN in the basket of a Condor crane are still assembling skeletons.
  A staircase climbs the far wall, to another wing.

        HAMMOND
      (continuing)
    - - the most advanced amusement park in the world,
    combining all the latest technologies.  I'm not talking
    rides, you know.  Everybody has rides.  We made a living
    biological attractions so astonishing they'll capture
    the imagination of the entire planet!

  Grant stares up at the dinosaur skeletons and just shakes his head.
  Ellie catches his reaction.

        ELLIE
    So what are you thinking?

        GRANT
    We're out of a job.

  Ian Malcolm pops in between them

        MALCOLM
    Don't you mean "extinct"?

  Ellie and Malcolm move on ahead.

  CUT TO:

19  INT SHOW ROOM DAY

        HAMMOND
    Why don't you all sit down.

  GRANT, ELLIE, and MALCOLM take their seats in the front row of
  the fifty seat auditorium.  GENNARO sits behind them.  HAMMOND walks
  over to the giant screen in front of them.

  Behind him, a huge image of himself beams down at him from the
  giant television screen.

        HAMMOND (screen)
    Hello, John!

        HAMMOND (stage)
      (to the group)
    Say hello!
      (then, fumbling with his three by five cards)
    Oh, I've got lines.

  He scans them, looking for his place.  The screen Hammond
  continues without him,

        HAMMOND (screen)
    Fine, I guess!  But how did I get here?!

        HAMMOND (stage)
    Uh - -
      (finding his place)
    "Here, let me show you.  First I'll need a drop of
    blood.  Your blood!"

  The screen-Hammond extends his finger and the stage-Hammond
  reaches out and mimes pocking it with a needle.

        HAMMOND (screen)
    Ouch, John!  That hurt!

        HAMMOND (stage)
    "Relax, John.  It's all part of the miracle of cloning!"

  While the two Hammonds rattle on, the screen image splits into
  two Hammonds, then four then eight, and so on, like a shampoo
  commercial.

  Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm huddle together excitedly in the
  audience.

        GRANT
    Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated
    an intact DNA strand!

        MALCOLM
    Not without massive sequence gaps!

        ELLIE
    Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100
    million year old dinosaur blood?!

        GENNARO
    Shhhhh!


20  IN THE FILM,

  the screen-Hammond is joined by another figure, this one
  animated.  MR. DNA is a cartoon character, a happy-go-lucky double-
  helix strand of recombinant DNA.  Mr. DNA jumps down onto the screen-
  Hammond's head and slides down his nose.

        HAMMOND
    Well!  Mr. DNA!  Where'd you come from?

        MR. DNA
    From your blood!  Just one drop of your blood contains
    billions of strands of DNA, the building blocks of life!


21  OMITTED


22  IN THE FILM,

  Mr. DNA has taken over the show, and is speaking to the audience
  from the screen.

        MR. DNA
    A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a
    living thing!  And sometimes animals that went extinct
    millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their
    blueprints behind for us to find!  We just had to know
    where to look!

  The screen image changes from animated to a nature- photography
  look.  It's an extreme close-up of a mosquito, its fangs suck the deep
  into some animals flesh, its body pulsing and engorging with blood it's
  drinking.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    A hundred million years ago, there were mosquitoes, just
    like today.  And, just like today, they fed on the blood
    of animals.  Even dinosaurs!

  The camera races back to show the mosquito is perched on top of
  a giant animated brachiosaur.

  The image changes, to another close-up, this one of a tree
  branch, its bark glistening with golden sap.  Mr. DNA leaps on the sap.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur, the mosquito would
    land on a branch of a tree, and get stuck in the sap!

  The engorged mosquito lands in the tree sap, and gets stuck.  So
  is Mr. DNA.  He tugs his legs, but they stay stuck.

        MR. DNA
    WHOA!

  Now the tree sap flows over them, covering up Mr. DNA and the
  mosquito completely.  Mr. DNA SHOUTS from inside the tree sap.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    After a long time, the tree sap would get hard and
    become fossilized, just like a dinosaur bone, preserving
    the mosquito inside!


23  A SCIENCE LABORATORY

  The place buzzes with activity.  Everywhere, there are piles of
  amber, tagged and labeled with SCIENTISTS in white coats examining it
  under microscopes.

  One SCIENTIST moves a complicated drill apparatus next to the
  chuck of amber with a fossilized mosquito inside and BORES into the
  side of it.  MR. DNA escapes through the drill hole as the Scientist
  moves the amber onto a microscope and peers through the eyepiece.

        MR. DNA (O.S.)
    This fossilized tree sap -- which we call amber �
    waited millions of years, with the mosquito inside �
    until Jurassic Park's scientists came along!


24  THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

  We see the greatly enlarged image of a mosquito through the
  lens.

        MR. DNA (O.S.)
    Using sophisticated techniques, they extract the
    preserved blood from the mosquito,
    and - -

  A long needle is inserted through the amber, into the thorax of
  the mosquito, and makes an extraction.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    - -Bingo!  Dino DNA!

  Mr. DNA jumps down in front of DNA data as it races by at
  headache speed.  He holds his head, dizzied by it.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes!
    If we looked at screens like these once a second for
    eight hours a day, it'd take two years to look at the
    entire strand!  It's that long!  And since it's so old,
    it's full of holes!  That's where our geneticists take
    over!


25A INT GENETICS LAB  DAY

  SCIENTISTS toil in a lab with two huge white towers at either
  side.

        MR. DNA
    Thinking Machine supercomputers and gene sequencers
    break down the strand in minutes - -

  One SCIENTIST, in the back has his arms encased in two long
  rubber tubes.  He's strapped into a bizarre apparatus, staring into a
  complex headpiece and moving his arms gently, like Tai Chi movements.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    - - and Virtual Reality displays show our geneticists
    the gaps in the DNA sequence!  Since most animal DNA is
    ninety percent identical, we use the complete DNA of a
    frog - -


25B ON THE V.R. DISPLAY

  we see an actual DNA strand, except it has a big hole in the
  center, where the vital information is missing.  Mr. DNA bounds into
  the frame, carrying a butch of letters in one hand.

  He puts it in the gap and turns back against it, GRUNTING as he
  shoves into place.

        MR. DNA
      (straining)
    - - to fill in the - - holes and - -complete - - the - -
      (finally getting it)
    - - code!  Whew!

  He brushes his hands off, satisfied.

        MR. DNA (cont'd)
    Now we can make a baby dinosaur!


26  IN THE AUDIENCE

  The scientist look at each other, not sure.

        HAMMOND
    All this has some dramatic music - - da dum da dum da
    dum dum - - march or something, it's not written yet,
    and the tour moves on - -

  He throws a switch and safety bars appear out of nowhere and
  drop over their seats, CLICKING into place.

        HAMMOND
    For your own safety!

  The row of seats moves out of the auditorium.


27  INT HALLWAY DAY

  The row of seats moves slowly past a row of double-panned glass
  window beneath a large sign that reads
  "GENETICS/FERTILIZATION/HATCHERY."  Inside, TECHNICIANS work at
  microscopes.

  In the back is a section entirely lit by blue ultraviolet light.

  Mr. DNA VOICE continues over a speaker in each seat.

        MR. DNA (O.S.)
    Our fertilization department is where the dinosaur DNA
    takes the place of the DNA in unfertilized emu or
    ostrich eggs - - and then it's on to the nursery, where
    we welcome the dinosaurs back into the world!

  GENNARO has a wondrous grin plastered on his face, just loving
  everything now.

        GENNARO
    This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters
    (people) animatronics?

        HAMMOND
    No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the
    real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

  GRANT, ELLIE, and MALCOLM are frustrated, leaning forward,
  straining against the safety bars for a better look.  But the cars keep
  going.

        GRANT
    Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular
    mitosis?!?

        ELLIE
    Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

  But the cars are already moving on to another set of windows,
  which give a glimpse into what looks like a control room.

        HAMMOND
    Shortly, shortly....

        MR. DNA (O.S.)
    Our control room contains some of the most sophisticated
    automation ever attempted
    in - -

  Grant strains to look back into the labs, but the cars move past
  again, no intention of slowing down.

        GRANT
    Can't you stop these things?!

        HAMMOND
    Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!

        GRANT
      (to Malcolm)
    Let's get outta here!

  The two of them team up on the safety bars.  Grant shoves his
  all the way back with one foot and Malcolm does the same.  They stand
  up and head for the door of the hatchery.

        GENNARO
    Hey!  You can't do that!

  Too late.  Ellie slips out from under her safety bar too
  and stomps right across Gennaro's seat.

        GENNARO
    Can they do that?

  They reach the door to the hatchery.  Grant tries to shove it
  open, but just THUDS into it.  He rattles the handle, but the door
  won't budge as it's on a security key-card system.

  HAMMOND steps up and takes his glasses off.

        HAMMOND
    Relax, Donald, relax.  They're scientists,  They ought
    to be curious.
      (he steps up to the code box)
    It's a retinal scanner.

  He pushes various code numbers.  The door opens.  He steps
  aside, and the group eagerly goes up the stairs.


28  INT.  HALLWAY/STAIRS  - DAY

  GRANT runs up the stairs.  MALCOLM and ELLIE eagerly try to get
  a look at the lab.  HAMMOND and GENNARO come up and join Grant at the
  door.

        GENNARO
    John, we - - what I'm just saying....

        HAMMOND
    Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to
    be curious.

  Hammond reaches the door,  Grant tries to pry it open.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Dr. Grant, just a minute, just a minute,
      (or)
    Dr. Grant, just a moment, dear boy.
    (he pushes the code; the door opens)
    Remember what Samuel Johnson said.
      (they step into the cubicle)
    "Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain
    characteristics of a vigorous intellect!"
      (the second door opens)
    Right!  Come along.


INT HATCHERY/NURSERY  DAY

  The hatchery is a vast, open room, bathed in infrared light.
  Long tables run the length of the place, all covered with eggs, their
  pale outlines obscured by hissing low mist that's all through the room.

        HAMMOND
    Come on in.

  HAMMOND takes off his hat and hands it one of the technicians.

  HENRY WU, late twenties, Asian-American, wearing a white lab
  coat works at a nearby table, making notes.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Good day, Henry.

        WU
    Oh, good day, Sir.

  GRANT goes to a round, open with various eggs under a strong
  light.

  One of the eggs makes strong movements - a robotic arm steadies
  the shell.

        GRANT
    My God!  Look!

  Hammond, Ellie, and Malcolm join him, as does Henry Wu.

        WU
    Ah, perfect timing!  I'd hoped they'd hatch before I had
    to go to the boat.

        HAMMOND
    Henry, why didn't you tell me?  you know I insist on
    being here when they're born.

  Hammond puts on a pair of plastic gloves.

  The egg begins to crack.  The robotic arm moves away....a BABY
  DINOSAUR tries to get out, just its head sticking out of the shell.

  Hammond reaches down and carefully breaks away egg fragments,
  helping the baby dinosaur out of its shell.

        HAMMOND
    Come on, then, out you come.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    They imprint on the first living creature they come in
    contact with.  That helps them to trust me.  I've been
    present for the birth of every animal on this Island.
    Just look at that.

        MALCOLM
    Surely not the ones that have bred in the wild?

        WU
    Actually, they can't breed in the wild.  Population
    control is one of our security precautions here.  There
    is no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park.

  Grant and Ellie exchange a look.  She manages not to smile.

        MALCOLM
    How do you know they can't breed?

        WU
    Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are females.
    (I've) We engineered them that way.

  Hammond keeps his attention trained on the new dinosaur.

        HAMMOND
    There you are.  Out you come.

        ELLIE
    Oh my God.

        HAMMOND
    Could I have a tissue please?

        WU
    Right away (certainly).  Coming right up.

  The animal is now free, Hammond sets in don carefully next to
  its shell.  Grant picks it up and holds it in the palm of his hand,
  under the incubator's heat light.

        GRANT
    Blood temperature feels like high eighties.

        HAMMOND
    Wu?

        WU
    Ninety-one.

  Grant picks up the large, broken half-shell, but the robotic arm
  snatches it back out of his hand, and puts it down.

        GRANT
    Homoeothermic?  It holds that temperature?
      (to Wu)
    Incredible.

  Malcolm is looking at Hammond, skeptical.

        MALCOLM
    But again, how do you know they're all female?  Does
    someone go into the park and, uh  - - lift up the
    dinosaurs' skirts?

        WU
    We control their chromosomes.  It's not that difficult.
    All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway.  It takes an extra
    hormone at the right developmental stage to create a male, and we
    simply deny them that.

        HAMMOND
    Your silence intrigues me.

        MALCOLM
    John, the kind of control you're attempting is not
    possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution
    has taught us, it's that life will not be contained.
    Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It
    crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even..
    dangerously, but and...well, there it is.

  Ellie listens to him, impressed.

        HAMMOND
    Watch her head - support her head.

  Grant, ignoring the others, picks up the baby dinosaur, and
  holds it on the palm of his hand, under the incubator's heat light.  He
  spreads the tiny animal out on the back of his hand and delicately runs
  his finger over its tail, counting the vertebrae.  A look of puzzled
  recognition crosses his face.

        WU
    You're implying that a group of composed entirely of
    females will breed?

        MALCOLM
    I'm simply saying that life - - finds a way.

        ELLIE
    "You can't control anything."  I agree with that.  I
    like that.

  She walks over to Malcolm, he smiles at her, too warmly.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    You can talk.  I don't k now how to say it.  You're just
    articulate.  You say everything that I think, that I
    feel.  It's exciting.
      (or)
    I find it so exciting.  It's exciting that you can't
    control life, that you know - -
      (or)
    You know that, I find it terrifying.  Life will always
    find a way.

        MALCOLM
    That's right.  Will break through.

        ELLIE
    I get ah - -

        MALCOLM
    I know, it's very exciting.

        ELLIE
    And scary.

        MALCOLM
    And scary.

        ELLIE
    When people try to control things that it's out of their
    power - -

        MALCOLM
    It's anti-nature.

        ELLIE
    Anti-nature.

  Grant doesn't notice, as he's still obsessed with the infant
  dinosaur, measuring and weighing it on a nearby lab bench.  He stops, a
  strange look on his face.  He knows what this animal is - - but it
  can't be.

        GRANT
      (dreading the answer)
    What species is this?

        WU
    Uh - - it's a Velociraptor.

  Grant and Ellie turn slowly and look at each other, then look at
  Hammond, astonished.

        GRANT
    You bred raptors?


29  EXT.  RAPTOR PEN  - DAY

  Grant charges across the compound, a fire in his eyes, ahead of
  ELLIE, MALCOLM, and GENNARO.  HAMMOND struggles to keep up.

        HAMMOND
    Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant?  Uh - -we planned to show you the
    raptors later, after lunch.

  But Grant has stopped abruptly next to the Velociraptor pen,
  which we recognize as the heavily fortified cage we some earlier, which
  the San Quentin towers at one end.

  Grant stands right up against the fence, eyes wide, dying for a
  glimpse.

  HAMMOND catches up, slightly out of breath.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Dr. Grant - - as I was saying, we've laid out lunch for
    you before you head out into the park.  Alejandro, our
    gourmet chef - -

        GRANT
    What are they doing?

  As they watch, a giant crane lowers something large down into
  the middle of the jungle foliage inside the pen.  Something very large.

  It's a steer.  They poor thing looks disconcerted as hell,
  helpless its in a harness, flailing its legs in the air.

        HAMMOND
    Feeding them.
      (moving along)
    Alejandro is preparing a delightful meal for us.  A
    Chilean sea bass, I believe.  Shall we?

  Grant goes up to the viewing deck.  The others follow, staring
  as the steer disappears into the shroud of foliage.  The line from the
  crane hangs for a moment.

  The jungle seems to grow very quiet.  They all stare at the
  motionless crane line.  It jerks suddenly, like a fishing pole finally
  getting a nibble.  There's a pause - -

  - - and then a frenzy.  The line jerks every which way, the
  jungle plants sway and SNAP from some frantic activity within, there is
  a cacophony of GROWLING, of SNAPPING, of wet CRUNCHES that mean the
  steer is literally being torn to pieces and is almost makes it worse
  that we can't see anything of what's going on - -

  - - and then it's quiet again.  The line jerks a few times, then
  stops.  Slowly the SOUND of the jungle starts up again.

        HAMMOND
    Fascinating animals, fascinating.

        ELLIE
    Oh my God.

        HAMMOND
    Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.

        GRANT
    I want to see them.  Can we get closer?

  Ellie puts a hand on his arm, like calming an overexcited child.

        ELLIE
    Alan, these aren't bones anymore.

        HAMMOND
    We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The
    raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a
    park setting.

  A VOICE comes from behind them.

        VOICE (O.S.)
    They should all be destroyed.

  They turn and look at the man who spoke.  ROBERT MULDOON, the
  grim-faced man who was present at the accident in the beginning, is
  fortyish, British.

  He joins them and takes his hat off.  When Muldoon talks, you
  listen.

        HAMMOND
    Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit
    of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the
    raptors more than anyone.

        GRANT
      (introducing himself)
    Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they
    have?  What's their growth rate?
      (or)
    rate of growth.

        MULDOON
    They're lethal at eight months.  And I do lethal.  I've
    hunted most things that can hunt you, but the way these
    things move - -

        GRANT
    Fast for biped?

        MULDOON
    Cheetah speed.  Fifty, sixty miles per hour if they ever
    got out in the open.  And they're astonishing jumpers.

        HAMMOND
    Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions.
    They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered
    glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -

        GRANT
    Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like
    theirs we assumed - -

        MULDOON
    They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving.
    Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but
    when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all
    but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at
    you, you can see she's thinking (or) working things
    out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this.
    She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders
    came.

        ELLIE
    The fences are electrified, right?

        MULDOON
    That's right.  But they never attack the same place
    twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses.
    Systematically.  They remembered.

  Behind them, the crane WHIRRS back to life, raising the cable
  back up out of the raptor pen.  The guest turn and stare as the end
  portion of the cable becomes visible.  The steer has been dragged
  completely away, leaving only the tattered, bloody harness.

  Hammond claps his hands together excitedly.

        HAMMOND
    Who's hungry?  After you, my dear.


30  INT.  VISITOR CENTER PRESENTATION ROOM - DAY

  HAMMOND, GRANT, ELLIE, MALCOLM, and GANNARO eat lunch at a long
  table in the visitor's center restaurant.

  There is a large buffet table and two WAITERS to serve them.

  The room is darkened and Hammond is showing slides of various
  scenes all around them.  Hammond's own recorded voice describes current
  and future features of the park while the slides flash artists'
  renderings of all them.

  The real Hammond turns and speaks over the narration.

        HAMMOND
  None of these attractions have been finished yet.  The
  park will open with the basic tour you're about to take,
  and then other rides will come on line after six or
  twelve months.  Absolutely spectacular designs.  Spared
  no expense.

  More slides CLICK past, a series of graphs dealing with profits,
  attendance and other fiscal projections.  Donald Gennaro, who has
  become increasingly friendly with Hammond, even giddy, grins from ear
  to ear.

        GENNARO
    And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day,
    ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then
    there's the merchandising - -

        HAMMOND
    Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the
    super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to
    enjoy these animals.

        GENNARO
    Sure, they will, they will.
      (laughing)
    We'll have a - - coupon day or something.

  Grant looks down, at the plate he's eating from.  It's in the
  shape of the island itself.  He looks at his drinking cup. It's got a
  T-rex on it, and a splashy Jurassic Park logo.

  There are a stack of folded amusement park-style maps on the
  table in front of Grant.  He picks one up.  Boldly, across the top it
  says, "Fly United to Jurassic Park!"

        HAMMOND
      (on tape)
    - - from combined revenue streams for all three parks
    should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -

        HAMMOND
      (to Gennaro)
    That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to
    speculate wildly.

        GENNARO
    I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it
    nice?

  Ian Malcolm, who was been watching the screens with outright
  contempt, SNORTS, as if he's finally had enough.

        MALCOLM
    The lack of humility before nature that's been displayed
    here staggers me.

  They all turn and look at him.

        GENNARO
    Thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little
    different than you and I feared.

        MALCOLM
    Yes, I know.  They're a lot worse.

        GENNARO
    Now, wait a second, we haven't even see the park yet.
    Let's just hold out concerns until - -
      (or alt. version)
    Wait - we were invited to this island to evaluate the
    safety conditions of the park, physical containment.
    The theories that all simple systems have complex
    behavior, that animals in a zoo environment will
    eventually begin to behave in an unpredictable fashion
    have nothing to do with that evaluation.  This is not
    some existential furlough, this is an on-site
    inspection.  You are a doctor.  Do your job.  You are
    invalidating your own assessment.  I'm sorry, John - -

        HAMMOND
    Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want
    to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.
      (or)
    I truly am.

        MALCOLM
    Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're
    doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force
    ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid
    who's found his dad's gun.

        MALCOLM GENNARO
    If I may....  It is hardly appropriate
    to start hurling
    Excuse me, excuse me - -  generalizations before - -
    I'll tell you.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    The problem with scientific power you've used is it
    didn't require any discipline to attain it.  You read
    what others had done and you took the next step.  You
    didn't earn the knowledge yourselves, so you don't take
    the responsibility for it.  You stood on the shoulders
    of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you
    could, and before you knew what you had, you patented
    it, packages it, slapped in on a plastic lunch box, and
    now you want to sell it.

        HAMMOND
    You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have
    done things no one could ever do before.

        MALCOLM
    Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not
    they could that they didn't stop to think if they
    should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't
    tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear
    reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!

        HAMMOND
    But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a
    second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the
    verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them
    on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!
      (or)
    have anything to say at all!

        MALCOLM
    Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by
    deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had
    their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.

        HAMMOND
    I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially
    from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of
    discovery and not act?

        MALCOLM
    There's nothing that great about discovery.
      (or)
    What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent,
    penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you
    call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!

        GENNARO
    Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr.
    Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?

        ELLIE
    The question is - - how much can you know about an
    extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume
    you can control it?  You have plants right here in this
    building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked
    them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive
    living things that have no idea what century they're
    living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if
    necessary.

  Exasperated, Hammond turns to Grant, who looks shell-shocked.

        HAMMOND
    Dr. Grant, if there's one person who can appreciate all
    of this - -
      (or)
    What am I trying to do?

  But Grant speaks quietly, really thrown by all of this.

        GRANT
    I feel - - elated and - - frightened and - -
      (starts over)
    The world has just changed so radically.  We're all
    running to catch up.  I don't want to jump to any
    conclusions, but look - -

  He leans forward, a look of true concern on his face.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Dinosaurs and man - - two species separated by 65
    million years of evolution - - have just been suddenly
    thrown back into the mix together.  How can we have the
    faintest idea of what to expect?

        HAMMOND
    I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here
    and defend me from these characters and the only one
    I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?

        GENNARO
    Thank you.

  One of the WAITERS whispers to Hammond.

        HAMMOND
    Ah - - they're here.

        GRANT
    Who?

A31 INT VISITOR'S CENTER LOBBY - DAY

  HAMMOND, GRANT, ELLIE, MALCOLM, and GENNARO walks out of the
  restaurant and into the lobby of the visitor's center.  They head down
  the stairs, and pass the skeletons of the dinosaurs again.

        HAMMOND
    You four are going to have a little company out in the
    park.  Spend a little time with our target audience.
    Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.

        GRANT
    What does he mean by "target audience"?

  Hammond turns toward the door of the center and throws his arms
  out expansively.

        HAMMOND
      (bellowing)
    KIDS!!

  Two kids standing in the doorway to the center break into a broad
  smiles.  TIM, the boy, is about nine years old; ALEXIX, his sister,
  looks around twelve.

        TIM & LEX
    Grandpa!

  They race across the lobby and into Hammond's arms, knocking him
  over on the steps.

        LEX
    We miss you.

        TIM
    Thanks for the presents.

        LEX
    We love the presents.

        HAMMOND
    You must be careful with me.  Did you like the
    helicopter?

        TIM
    It was great!  It drops, we were dropping!

  Grant looks on.


31  EXT VISITOR'S CENTER  DAY

  Two modified Ford Explorers leap up out of an underground garage
  beneath the visitor's center.  They move quietly, with a faint
  electronic HUM, and straddle a partially buried metal rail is the
  middle of the road.  They pull to a stop where the group is gathered.

  Ellie is off to the side with ALEXIS, introducing herself
  warmly.

  HAMMOND is with MALCOLM, GRANT, and GENNARO.

        HAMMOND
    Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a
    divorce and they need the diversion.

        GENNARO
    Hey!  Where are the brakes?

        HAMMOND
    Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided
    by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting,
    top of the line!

        LEX
    It's interactive CD-ROM.  Look, see - - you just touch
    the right part of the screen and it talks about whatever
    you want.

        HAMMOND
    Spared no expense.  Have fun.  I'll be watching you from
    the control (or) back in control.
      (to Ellie)
    Come along, my dear.  You'll ride in the second car, I
    can promise you you'll have a real wonderful time.

        ELLIE
    Oh thank you so much.  So you'll see you later then.

  Hammond turns and head back towards the Visitor's Center.

        MALCOLM
      (too eagerly; to Grant)
    I'll ride with Dr. Sattler.
      (or)
    I'm going to ride with Dr. Sattler.

  He turns and walks over to Ellie.  Grant frowns, not liking this
  one bit.  He moves to follow, but TIM cuts him off, and stares up at
  him, wide-eyed

        TIM
    I read your book.

        GRANT
    Oh, yeah - - great.

  Grant heads for the rear car.  Tim follows.

        TIM
    You really think dinosaurs turned into birds?  And
    that's where all the dinosaurs went?

  Grant opens the door of the rear car and climbs in.  Tim
  follows.

        GRANT
    Well, uh, a few species - - may have evolved, uh - -
    along those lines - - yeah.

  A mechanical voice intones from inside:

        VOICE
    "Two to four passengers to a car, please.  Children
    under ten must be accompanied by an adult."

  Tim is right behind Grant, so Grant keeps moving, across the
  back seat of the car and out the other door.  But Tim follows.

        TIM
    Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard
    a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred
    mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -

        GRANT
    Listen, ahh - -

        TIM
    Tim.

        GRANT
    Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -

        TIM
    Whichever one you are.

  Grant goes to the front car again, opens the rear door, and
  holds it for Tim, who climbs in the back seat, rattling on and on.

        TIM
    Then I head about this thing in OMNI?  About the meteor
    making all this heat that made a bunch of diamond dust?
    And that changed the weather and they died because of
    the weather?  Then my teacher told me about this other
    book by a guy named Bakker?  And he said the dinosaurs
    died of a bunch of diseases.

  SLAM!  Grant closes the car door on Tim.  He turns and head for
  the rear vehicle - -

  - - and bumps right into Lex.

        LEX
      (points at Ellie)
    She said I should ride with you because it would be good
    for you.

  Grant looks over at Ellie, annoyed.

        GRANT
    She's a deeply neurotic woman.

32  INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  The Jurassic Park control room looks like a mission control for
  a space launch, with several computer terminals and dozens of video
  screens that display images of various dinosaurs, taken from all over
  the park.

  There's a large glass map of the island at the front of the room
  that is lit up like a Christmas tree with various colored lights, each
  one with a number and identification code next to it.

  But the place is unfinished, with unattached cables,
  construction materials, and ladders scattered about.

  The mood among the half dozen TECHNICIANS present is chaotic as
  they rush around with last-minute adjustments.

  MULDOON whisks in through the double doors.  HAMMOND is right
  behind him.  They go straight to the main console, where RAY ARNOLD
  fortyish, a chronic worrier and chain-smoker, is seated.

        MULDOON
    National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm
    about seventy-five miles west of us.

  Hammond sighs and looks over Arnold's shoulder.

        HAMMOND
    Why didn't I build in Orlando?

        MULDOON
    I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like
    the last one.

        HAMMOND
      (a deep breath)
    Ray, start the tour program.

  He punches a button on the console.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
      (not exactly comforting)
    Hold onto your butts.


  CUT TO:


33  EXT VISITOR'S CENTER  DAY

  With a loud CHUNK, the Explorers start forward along the
  electrical pathway.

  GENNARO, TIM, and LEX are in the front vehicle; GRANT, ELLIE,
  and MALCOLM in the rear.


33A EXT MAIN GATES  DAY

  They pass through two enormous, primitive gates, torches blazing
  on either side.


34  EXT JURASSIC PARK DAY

  IN THE REAR CAR, the Explorer's speakers BLARE with fanfare of
  trumpets, and the interior video screen flashes "Welcome to Jurassic
  Park."  A familiar VOICE comes over the speaker:

        VOICE (O.S.)
    Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now entering the lost
    world of the prehistoric past, a world - -

        VOICE (cont'd)
    creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which
    you are privileged to see for the first time.

INT CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND watches the monitor.  His grandchildren are enjoying
  themselves.

        HAMMOND
    By the way, that's James Earl Jones (or) Richard Kiley.
    We spared no expense!

  IN THE PARK,

  the fences are retaining walls are covered with greenery and
  growth, to heighten the illusion of moving through a jungle.

  IN THE FRONT CAR

        GENNARO
    The accident took place in a restricted area.  It would
    not have been available to the public access.  So how
    can the safety of the public be called into question?

  The cars come to the top of a low rise, where a break in the foliage
  gives them a view down a sloping field that is broken by a river.  The
  tour voice continues.

        VOICE (O.S.)
  To the right, you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs
  on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  Tim and Lex practically SLAM up against the windows, to get a look.

        GENNARO
      (keeps talking)
    The safety.  That's the problem I had to answer.

        LEX
    Shhh.

        TIM
    I can't see.

        GENNARO
    What are we looking for?

        TIM
    Dilophosaurus.

  IN THE REAR CAR

  Grant looks at his map.  Ellie, hearing the voice, reacts.

        ELLIE
    Oh, shit.

        GRANT
    Dilophosaurus.

  Grant, Malcolm, and Ellie press against the windows.

  DOWN NEAR THE RIVER BANK

  there are a lot of beautiful plants, but no sign of a herd of anything.
  The tour voice continues anyway.

        VOICE (O.S.)
  One of the earliest carnivores, we now know
  Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous, spitting its venom
  at its prey, causing blindness and eventually paralysis,
  allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure.  This
  makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful, but deadly addition to
  Jurassic Park.

  Corny SCARY MUSIC plays over the speaker.

  IN THE FRONT CAR,

        TIM
    There's nothing there!

  IN THE REAR CAR,

        ELLIE
    Alan, where?

  Grant and the others sit back, disappointed.

        GRANT
    Damn.

  ON THE ROAD,

  the cars move on.  As they roll past, we notice the headlights are on,
  even in the daytime.


  CUT TO:


35  INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

  RAY ARNOLD watches his computer screen and the video monitors at
  the same time, keeping an eye on the cars as they move through the
  park.  HAMMOND hovers over his shoulder.

        ARNOLD
    Vehicle headlights are on and don't respond.  Those
    shouldn't be running off the car batteries.

    He signs and reaches for a clipboard hanging next to his chair
    and jots this down.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    Item one fifty-one on today's glitch list.  We've got
    all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo,
    and the computer's not even on its feet yet.

  Hammond shakes his head and turns to the TECHNICIAN to his
  right, who still has his back to them, watching a Costa Rican game show
  on one of his monitors and drinking a Jolt cola.

        HAMMOND
    Dennis, our lives are in your hands and you have
    butterfingers.

  The Technician turns around his chair and extends his arms in a
  Christ-like pose.  As we get a good look at him, we get the sinking
  feeling that we've seen him somewhere before.  And we have.  DENNIS
  NEDRY is the man who accepted a suitcase full of cash in San Jose.

        NEDRY
    I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the
    whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to
    three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy?
    Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight
    Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code
    for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like
    to see them try.

        HAMMOND
    I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am.
    But they are your problems.

        NEDRY
    You're right, John.  You're absolutely right.
    Everything's my problem.

        HAMMOND
    I will not get drawn into another financial conversation
    with you, Dennis.  I really will not.

        NEDRY
    I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no
    debate...my mistakes....

        HAMMOND
    I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask
    that they pay for them.

        NEDRY
    Thanks, Dad.

        ARNOLD
    Dennis - -the headlights.

        NEDRY
    I'll de-bug the tour program when they get back.  Okay?
    It'll eat a lot of computer cycles; parts of the system
    may go down for a while - - Don't blame me.  If I am
    playing...losing memory....

  MULDOON, who has been hovering near the video monitors as
  always, turns towards them, annoyed.

        MULDOON
  Quiet, all if you.  They're coming to the tyrannosaur
  paddock.


  CUT TO:


36  EXT TYRANNOSAUR PADDOCK DAY

  The two Explorers drive along a high ridge and stop at the edge
  of the large, open plain that is separated from the road by a fifteen-
  foot fence, clearly marked with "DANGER!" signs and ominous-looking
  electrical post.

  TIM, LEX, and GENNARO are pressed forward against the windows,
  eyes wide, waiting for you-know-who.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

  The voice of the radio drones on, but GRANT, ELLIE, and MALCOLM
  aren't even listening anymore, dying of anticipation.

        VOICE (O.S.)
    The mighty tyrannosaurus arose late in the dinosaur
    history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for hundred and
    fifty million years, but it wasn't until the last- -

        GRANT
    Will you turn that thing off?

  Ellie flips a switch and they wait in silence - - except for
  Malcolm, who looks at the ceiling, thinking aloud.

        MALCOLM
    God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God
    creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.

        ELLIE
      (finishing it for him)
    Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.

        ARNOLD (O.S.)
    Hold on, we'll try to tempt the rex.

  IN THE PADDOCK,

  there is a low HUMMING sound.  Out in the middle of the field, a
  small cage rises up into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.

  The cage bars slide down, leaving the cage's occupant standing
  alone in the middle of the field.

  It's a goat, one leg chained to a stake.  It looks around,
  confused, and BLEATS plaintively.

  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  LEX and TIM look at the goat with widely different reactions.

        LEX
    What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat
    the goat?!

        TIM
      (in heaven)
    Excellent.

        GENNARO
      (to Lex)
    What's the matter, kid, you never had lamb chops?

        LEX
    I happen to be a vegetarian.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

        GRANT
    (shakes his head)
  T-rex doesn't want to be fed; he wants to hunt.  You
  can't just suppress sixty-five million years of gut
  instinct.

  IN THE PADDOCK

  The goat waits.  And waits.  From the Explorers, six faces watch
  it expectantly.  The goat tugs on its chain.  It walks back and forth,
  nervous.  It BLEATS.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

  Grant watches, his eyes glued, his breathing becoming a little
  more rapid.

  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  Tim and Lex can't tear their eyes away,

  IN THE PADDOCK,

  finally, the goat - -

  - - lays down.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

  everyone sits back, disappointed again, as the cars pull forward
  to continue the tour.  Malcolm picks up the microphone.

        MALCOLM
    Now, eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your
    dinosaur tour, right?


37  INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  HAMMOND just shakes his head as Malcolm's voice comes through,

        HAMMOND
    I really hate that man.


38  EXT PARK  DAY

  GRANT gets into the seat, leaving MALCOLM behind ELLIE.  He
  longingly looks out of the opposite window, while Malcolm rattles on to
  Ellie.

        MALCOLM
    You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or
    park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.

        ELLIE
    I'm still not clear on Chaos.

        MALCOLM
    It simply deals with unpredictability in complex
    systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect.
    A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central
    Park you get rain instead of sunshine.

  Ellie gestures with her hand to show this information has gone
  right over her head.

        MALCOLM
    I made a fly by, I go too fast.

  Looking out of the opposite window, Grant sees movement at the
  far end of a field.  He sits bolt upright, trying to get a better look.

  Malcolm, looking for another example - -

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
      (points to the glass of water)
    Here.  Give me your glass of water.

  He dips his hand into the glass of water.  He takes Ellie's hand
  in his own.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    Make like hieroglyphics.  Now watch the way the drop of
    water falls on your hand.

  He flicks his fingers and a drop falls on the back of Ellie's
  hand.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    Ready?  Freeze your hand.  Now I'm going to do the same
    thing from the exact same place.  Which way is the drop
    going to roll off?
      (or)
    Which way will the drop roll?  Over which finger?  Or
    down your thumb?  Or to the other side?

        ELLIE
    Uh - - thumb!
      (or)
    The same way.

        MALCOLM
    It changed.  Why?
      (or)
    Okay, back over your wrist.
      (then)
    Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - -
    the orientations of the hairs - -

        ELLIE
    Alan, listen to this.

        MALCOLM
    - - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your
    vessels, imperfections in the skin - -

        ELLIE
    Oh, imperfections?

        MALCOLM
    Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the
    outcome.  That's what?

        ELLIE
    Unpredictability....

        MALCOLM
    And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's
    going on in this park right now.

  There's definitely something out in that field, and Grant has to
  see it.

  He jerks on the door handle and opens his door a few inches.  He
  looks outside towards freedom, then looks around to is anybody's
  watching him.

  Malcolm lowers his voice, becoming more seductive now.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    Life's a lot like that, isn't it?  You meet someone by
    chance you'll never meet again, and the course of your
    whole future changes.  It's dynamic - - its exciting - -
    I think.

  Grant throws the door open and bolts out of the moving car.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    There, there see?!  I'm right again!

        ELLIE
    Alan?

        MALCOLM
    No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly
    jump out of a moving vehicle!

        ELLIE
    Alan?

  She jumps out too and follows him into the field.

        MALCOLM
    There's another example!

  IN THE FRONT CAR,

        TIM
    Hey!  I want to go with them!

  IN THE REAR CAR,

        MALCOLM
    See?  Here I am now, by myself, talking to myself - -
    that's Chaos Theory!  What the hell am I doing here?
    I'm the only one who knows what's going on, etc, etc....

39  INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  HAMMOND, MULDOON, and ARNOLD stare at the video monitor
  incredulously as everyone now pouts out of the cars and follows Grant
  down the hill.

  The cars roll on slowly, empty, their doors hanging open.

        ARNOLD
    Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -

        HAMMOND
    Stop the program!  Stop the program!

        MULDOON
    There you are!  How many times did I tell you we needed
    locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors!

  ACROSS THE ROOM

  DENNIS NEDRY sneaks a peek at the video monitor.  It shows an
  image of the steel door, plainly marked - - "EMBRYONIC COLD STORAGE.
  RESTRICTED!"

  He looks to another monitor, which is labeled "EAST DOCK."  The
  monitor shows a supply ship, moored at the dock.  Its cargo is being
  uploaded and a large group of WORKERS is filing aboard.

  Nedry has something in the counter, where no one can see it.
  It's a can of shaving cream.

40  EXT PARK  DAY

  GRANT, ELLIE, GENNARO, and the KIDS are out in the open field,
  heading towards a small stand of trees.  For the first time, we notice
  the sky is darken rather early in the day.  Tim dogs Grant's footsteps,
  so excited he can hardly keep his feet on the ground.

        TIM
    So like I was saying, there's this other book by a guy
    named Bakker?  And he said dinosaurs died of a bunch of
    diseases?  He definitely didn't say they turned into
    birds.

  Gennaro is scared as hell, following the others, but his head
  darting left and right.

        ELLIE
    Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?

        GENNARO
    Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?

        TIM
    And his book was a lot fatter than yours.

        GRANT
    Really?

        ELLIE
    Yours was fully illustrated, honey.

        GENNARO
    Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.

  Lex stumbles and Grant takes her hand, to stop her from falling.
  She looks up at him and smiles.

  Grant smiles back and tries to recover his hand, but Lex holds
  tight.  He's massively uncomfortable.  Ellie notices.

  Suddenly they all stop in their tracks.  A huge smile spreads
  across the faces of both Tim and Grant.  Grant walks forward.  Tim
  follows.

        ELLIE
    Timmy, Timmy.

        LEX
    Come back here, blanket head.

  Fearless, Tim walks forward behind Grant.

        HARDING (O.S.)
    Hi everybody,  Don't be scared.

  Tim reaches the clearing and sees:

  A Triceratops, a big one, lying on its side, blocking the light
  at the end of the path.  It has an enormous curved shell that flanks
  its head, two big horns over its eyes, and a third on the end of its
  nose.  It doesn't move, just breathes, loud and raspy, blowing up a
  little clouds of dust with every exhalation.

  Grant stands next to Harding, almost in a daze.

        GRANT
    Beautiful.  Is it okay?  Can I touch it?

        HARDING
    Sure.

  Grant walks next to the animal and strokes its head.  Ellie
  moves forward to the animal.

        GRANT
    Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful
    thing I ever saw.

        ELLIE
    It's my favorite.

  They both kneel, checking the animal.

  He furrows his bow, noticing something, all professional
  curiosity now.  The animal's tongue, dark purple, droops limply from
  its mouth.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Ellie, take a look at this.

        ELLIE
    Yeah, baby girl, it's okay.

  She scratches the tongue with her fingernail.  A clear liquid
  leaks from the broken blisters.

        ELLIE
    Micro vesicles.  That's interesting.

  Grant, fascinated, wanders all the way around to the back of the
  animal.  Harding joins Ellie and hands her his penlight.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    What are her symptoms?

        HARDING
    Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to
    happen about every six weeks or so.

        ELLIE
    Six weeks?

  She takes the penlight from the veterinarian and shines it in
  the animal's eyes.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    Are there pupillary effects from the tranquilizer?

        HARDING
    Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.

        ELLIE
    These are dilated.  Take a look.

        HARDING
    They are?
      (checks it out)
    I'll be damned.

        ELLIE
    That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.

  She turns and studies the surrounding landscape.  Her mind's
  really at work, puzzling over each piece of foliage.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
      (pointing)
    Is that (or) this West Indian lilac?

        HARDING
    Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat
    them.

        ELLIE
    Are you sure?

        HARDING
    Pretty sure.

        ELLIE
    There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some
    droppings.
      (or)
    I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

        HARDING
    You won't be able to miss them.
      (or)
    Can't miss them.

  Malcolm walks up to Ellie.

        MALCOLM
    Dino droppings?

        ELLIE
    Yeah.

  She walks way, Malcolm looks on.


41A INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  HAMMOND and ARNOLD are watching the video monitors, displeased
  about something.  Arnold is looking at one that gives them a view from
  the beach, looking out at the ocean.  The clouds beyond are almost
  black with a tropical storm.

        ARNOLD
    That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course.
    We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid.
    Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.

        HAMMOND
    You're sure we have to?

        ARNOLD
    It's not worth taking the chance, John.

        MULDOON
      (into phone)
    Sustain winds 45 knots.

        HAMMOND
      (nods)
    Tell them when they get back to the cars.

        MULDOON
      (into phone)
    Thanks, Steve.

        ARNOLD
      (making an announcement to the others)
    Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in
    approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and
    leave now.

        HAMMOND
    Damn!


41  ACROSS THE ROOM

  NEDRY stares at his video monitor, watching the boat.  He's on
  the phone with the MATE, whose images he can see on the monitor.  The
  seas around the dock are much rougher now.

        MATE
    We're not well-berthed here without a storm barrier!  We
    may have to leave as soon as the last of the works are
    aboard.

        NEDRY
      (low voice)
    No, no.  You stick to the plan.  You wait till they're
    back from the tour.



42  EXT FIELD DAY

  As the weather grows darker, ELLIE, GRANT, HARDING, and MALCOLM
  are grouped around an enormous spoor of triceratops excreta that stands
  at least waist high and is covered with BUZZING flies.

        MALCOLM
    That is one big pile of shit.

  Ellie has plastic gloves on the reach up to her elbows, and is
  just withdrawing her hand from the middle of the dung.

        ELLIE
      (to Harding)
    You're right.  There's no trace of lilac berries.
    That's so weird, though.  She shows all the classic
    signs of Meliatoxicity,
      (thinking aloud)
    Every six weeks - -

  She turns and walks out into the open field a few paces,
  thinking.  Malcolm watches her, and looks back at the dung.

        MALCOLM
      to Grant)
    She's, uh - - tenacious.

        GRANT
    You have no idea.

        MALCOLM
      to Ellie)
    You will remember to wash your hands before you eat
    anything?


43  INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  DENNIS NEDRY is busily and surreptitiously typing a series of
  commands into his console.  On his screen, a cartoon hand winds up a
  cartoon clock, moving its second hand up to the twelve.  The clock
  rotates around to face us.

  It has a large green dollar sign in the middle.  A big word
  appears on screen, an option surrounded by forbidding red box.
  "EXECUTE," it says.


44  EXT PARK  DAY

  The skies are really foreboding now, and there's a sense of
  growing urgency.  ELLIE is by the animal, a short distance away from
  the group.  GRANT is near her, thinking.

        GRANT
  Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the
  periodicity doesn't had up.

        ELLIE
    I know.

  Tim holds one of the smooth rocks up and calls out, a little
  timidly.

        TIM
    These look kind of familiar.

        GRANT
    Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant
    browsers would be constantly sick.

        ELLIE
    Constantly sick.

        GRANT
    Not just every six weeks.

        ELLIE
    Yeah, I know.

        TIM
    I've seen pictures of these!

  Grant turns and looks at him, a little annoyed.

        TIM
    In your fully illustrated book.

  Grant just rolls his eyes, but Ellie comes over and checks out
  the stones.

        ELLIE
    What's that?

  A light goes on in her eyes.

        ELLIE
    Alan - - gizzard stones!

  She throws Grant one of the stones.  They look at each other in
  amazement.

  As before, when they get excited, they talk right over each
  other.

        GRANT
    Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -

        ELLIE
    - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -

        GRANT
    - - totally incidental
      (or)
    unrelated to the feeding pattern - -

        TIM
    What are you guys saying?

        ELLIE
      (turning to Tim)
    It's simple, see.  Some animals like her, don't have
    teeth - -

        GRANT
    - - like birds - -

        ELLIE
    - - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones
    and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -

        GRANT
    - - a gizzard - -

        ELLIE
    - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash
    their food, but what happens after a while - -

        GRANT
    - - what happens is that after a while, the stones get
    smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them
    - -

        ELLIE
      (for Tim)
    - - barfs them up - -

        GRANT
    - - and swallows fresh ones.

        ELLIE
    And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the
    poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.
      (impressed)
    Good work Tim.

  She looks at Grant pointedly.  Tim looks up at Grant too,
  smiling from ear to ear.  Grant GRUNTS, not so easily convinced.

  THUNDER rumbles as the storm overhead is about to bust loose.
  GENNARO, scared of more than one thing now, puts his foot down.

        GENNARO
    Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get
    moving.

        ELLIE
  Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr.
  Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?

        HARDING
    Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at
    the visitor's center before I make the boat with the
    others.

        ELLIE
      (to Grant)
    I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.

        GRANT
    Are you sure?

        ELLIE
    I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.

  There is a lightning flash now, with a tooth-rattling
  THUNDERCLAP right on its heels.

        GENNARO
    Now.

  Grant turns and follows the others, Lex right in his tracks.
  Ellie and Harding go back to the triceratops, which is starting to come
  back to life.

  As Grant reaches the Explorer, he turns back for one last look
  at Ellie.  He raises his hand to wave, but she is turned the other way.
  Feeling silly, he drops his hand and goes into the woods.  Just as he
  does, Ellie turns and waves to him, but with his back turned, he misses
  it too.

  In this way, they say goodbye.

  BACK AT THE CARS,

  as the reflections of the GROUP approach, the first raindrops
  fall on the windshields of the tour vehicles.  They're big, fat drops,
  and they kick up little clouds of dust as they SMACK into the glass.

  It's going to be a hell of a storm.

46  EXT PARK  DUSK

  It's near dark now.  The wind has whipped up, and the trees are
  swaying.


47  INT CONTROL ROOM  DUSK

  HAMMOND is with RAY ARNOLD, staring at the video screens.

        ARNOLD
    I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm
    turning the cars around in the rest area loop.

        HAMMOND
    Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the
    radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee
    bit of rain.

  Arnold reaches for the hand microphone.

  ACROSS THE ROOM,

  DENNIS NEDRY, sweat forming on his upper lip now, is staring at
  his video monitor.  The supply boat is still docked on the island
  shore, but is now being buffeted by heavy waves.  Nedry whispers
  sharply into the phone, arguing with the MATE of the ship again, who he
  can see on the video monitor.

        MATE
    There's nothing I can do!  If the Captain says we gotta
    go, we gotta go!

        NEDRY
    No, no, listen to me.  You've got to give me this time.
    I did a test run on this thing and it took me twenty
    minutes.  I thought I could do it in fifteen - - you've
    got to give me fifteen minutes.

        MATE
    No promises!  No promises!

        NEDRY
    I'll be there in ten!

  Arnold SNAPS a button on his console.

        ARNOLD
    Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.

        HAMMOND
    So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one
    sick triceratops.

        ARNOLD
    It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a
    lot worse.

  Dennis Nedry stands up.

  He's shaking in his shoes, but trying like hell to be casual.

        NEDRY
    Anybody want a Coke?  Anybody what some from the
    machines?  Or a soda or something?  I had too many
    sweets.
      (or)
    I thought I'd get something sweet.

  Hammond and Arnold shake their heads.  Nedry starts to leave,
  then turns back with an afterthought that is so rehearsed its almost
  obvious.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Oh, I finished de-bugging the phones, but the system's
    compiling for eighteen minutes, or twenty.  So, some
    minor systems may go on and off for a while.  There's
    nothing to worry about.  Simple thing....

        HAMMOND
    Okay, okay, okay, okay, that's enough!  Ahh!

  Nedry turns, stretches one finger out to his screen, and selects
  an option.

  "EXECUTE."

  At the same time, he presses the start button on his digital
  stopwatch he holds in his hand.  A digital clock on the computer screen
  starts to tick down from sixty seconds , and a musical clock starts to
  sound too - - something like the "Jeopardy" theme.

  He starts to leave - - but returns when he remembers the shaving
  cream can.  He grabs it and leaves.


48  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  Night was completely fallen now, and the rain has started.  It's
  a tropical storm, the rain falling in drenching sheets on the roofs and
  hoods of the Explorers, which are making their way slowly back to the
  visitor's center.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

  GRANT and MALCOLM are alone.  Grant is staring out the window,
  lost in his thoughts.

        GRANT
    You got any kids?

        MALCOLM
    Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.
      (glowing)
    I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does
    happen.

  He takes a flask from jacket pocket and unscrews the top.  His
  expression darkens.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    Same with wives, for that matter.

        GRANT
    You're married?

        MALCOLM
    Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex-
    Mrs. Malcolm.


49  INT FERTILIZATION LAB NIGHT

  DENNIS NEDRY, waits outside the silver door marked "EMBRYONIC
  COLD STORAGE," staring at the digital stopwatch in his hand.

        NEDRY
    Two - - one - -

  On cue, the security lock panel goes dark and the door CLUNKS
  ajar.

  IN THE COOLER,

  Nedry hurries in and flips open the hatch on the bottom of the
  shaving cream can, revealing slotted compartments inside.  He goes to
  the rack of dozens of thin glass slides.  A sign says "VIABLE EMBRYOS -
  - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE!"

  He takes the slides out of the rack one by one.  They're labeled
  - - "STEGOSAURUS", "APATOSAURUS", "TYRANNOSAURUS REX" - - and puts them
  into the can.


50  INT CONTROL ROOM  NIGHT

  ARNOLD is staring at his terminal, puzzled.  On the screen,
  glowing red and blue lines are blinking off, in succession..

        ARNOLD
    What?

  HAMMOND comes up behind him, as does ROBERT MULDOON.

        HAMMOND
    What?

        ARNOLD
    The door security systems are shutting down.

        HAMMOND
    Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't
    he?

53  INT REAR CAR  NIGHT

  GRANT and MALCOLM still wait in their car.  They don't notice,
  but the video screen in the middle of their front console suddenly goes
  black.

  Malcolm continues their conversation.

        MALCOLM
    By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available,
    is she? - -

        GRANT
    Why?

        MALCOLM
    Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish
    you the best luck.

  The cars jerk to a stop.  The lights in the vehicles and along
  the road go out, plunging them into blackness.  Grant jerks his hands
  away from the steering column, immediately assuming it's his fault.

        GRANT
    What'd I touch?!

        MALCOLM
    You haven't touched
      (or)
    didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.
      (or)
    We've stopped.

        GRANT
    I must've touched something.  This happens all the time.
    It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.

        MALCOLM
    Machines hate you?

        GRANT
    Yeah, they hate me.

        MALCOLM
    You want to talk about this?

        GRANT
    No.


54  EXT JURASSIC PARK NIGHT

  Nedry's jeep SPLASHES up to the giant gates that lead into
  Jurassic Park.  NEDRY jumps out and hurries to the control panel on the
  side of the cement supports.

  He FLICKS a switch and gates CLICK unlocked.

  He jumps back in the car and noses into the gates, shoving them
  open far enough to drive through.

  He ROARS into the park grounds


55  EXT CONTROL ROOM  NIGHT

  RAY ARNOLD stares at his terminal, aghast, as row upon row of
  colored lights crawls off on his screen.

        ARNOLD
    Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?

        HAMMOND
    What now?

        ARNOLD
    Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor
    systems, he said!

        HAMMOND
      (to Muldoon, pissed)
    Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!

        ARNOLD
  The monitors are failing.

  Muldoon heads for the door just as all the video monitors in the
  control room go out with a faint electronic ZIP.

  The three of them freeze for a moment, looking at each other.
  The tension in the room goes up a notch.

        HAMMOND
      (to Arnold)
    Use Nedry's terminal.  Get it all back on.  He can de-
    bug later.

  ARNOLD pushes off on the floor and whizzes over to Nedry's
  master terminal in his chair.  With one stroke of his arm, he brushes
  all the loose junk off Nedry's station - junk food, soda cans, torn out
  magazine pages - - and tries to work.

        ARNOLD
    God, look at this workstation.

  The "Jeopardy"-type music is playing a little faster now.

  Muldoon steps forward, growing alarmed.

        MULDOON
    The raptor fences aren't out, are they?

        ARNOLD
      (checks)
    No, they're still on.

        HAMMOND
    Why the hell would he turn the others off?!


56  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  A wire mesh fence in front of us has a very clear sign:

  DANGER!  ELECTRIFIED FENCE!
  This Door Cannot Be Opened
  When Fence is Armed!

  A hand reaches out, grabs the fence by the bare wire, flips a
  latch, and shoves the door open.  No sparks fly.

  DENNIS NEDRY runs from the fence back to his jeep, drops it in
  gear, and tears off down the park road.  The rain is absolutely flowing
  down now, the road is rapidly turning to mud.

  IN THE JEEP,

  Nedry can barely see through the windshield.  He's driving as
  fast as possible, checking his watch every few seconds.

  He leans forward, squinting to see through  the windshield,
  wiping off the condensation with his free hand.  A fork in the road
  rushes into view.  He jumps on the brakes - - to late.  The jeep
  careens into a signpost.

        NEDRY
    Shit!

  He throws the door open and hurries to the fallen sign:  "To The
  Docks".  He props it up - the directional arrow swings hopelessly on a
  nail.  He clenches his jaws and growls.

  Soaked, Nedry stomps back to his car.

  Although he doesn't look too convinced, he drops the car in gear
  and speeds off to the left.


57  EXT CONTROL ROOM  NIGHT

  HAMMOND still hovers over ARNOLD's shoulder while he works at
  Nedry's terminal.  Arnold MUTTERS to himself as he tries another
  command.

        ARNOLD
    - - access main program grid - -

  He punches a button, but a BUZZER sounds and a little cartoon
  image of Nedry appears on the screen and waves its little finger
  disapprovingly.

        CARTOON NEDRY
    "You didn't say the magic word!"

        ARNOLD
      (livid)
    Please, God damn it!  I hate this hacker crap!

  He SMACKS the top of the monitor, furious.  The game show music
  plays still faster.

        HAMMOND
    Call Nedry's people in Cambridge!

  Arnold whisks across the floor in his chair and snatches up the
  nearest phone.  He punches for an outside line.

        ARNOLD
    Phones are out too.

        HAMMOND
    Where did the vehicles stop?


58  EXT TYRANNOSAUR PADDOCK NIGHT

  BAAA!  The goat that was brought up from the underground earlier
  is still tethered in the same place, BLEATING in the pouring rain

  The two explorers sit still in the middle of the road.  A man's
  form races back from the front car to the rear car.

  IN THE REAR CAR,

  GRANT, soaking wet, gets back into the care and closes the door
  behind him.  MALCOLM turns to him.

        GRANT
    Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.

        MALCOLM
    The kids okay?

        GRANT
    Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

        MALCOLM
    Kids get scared.

        GRANT
    What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in
    the power.

        MALCOLM
    I didn't say I was scared.

        GRANT
    I didn't say you were scared.

        MALCOLM
    I know.

        GRANT
    Fine.

  Malcolm turns and looks out at the driving rain, and the fence
  that stands between them and the tyrannosaur paddock.  He is scared.


59  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  GENNARO, LEX, and TIM wait, bored.  The rain drums on the roof
  monotonously.  Tim is upside down in the front seat.  Lex pushes his
  legs up, and he swings them down.

        TIM
    Up and down, up and down!

        GENNARO
      (sotto)
    I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.

        TIM
    People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head
    - - aneurisms - -

        LEX
      (a little dreamy)
    I think Dr. Grant is really - - smart.

        GENNARO
    How he'll write a butch of (letters) papers, go on Larry
    King Live, say we're irresponsible - -

  Tim climbs into the back seat.  Lex hits him with her hat as he
  moves by her.

        LEX
    Don't scare me.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -????- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Tim finds something under the seat and sits up abruptly, holding
  what looks like a heavy-duty pair of safety goggles.

        GENNARO
    Hey!  Where did you find those things?

        TIM
    In a box under my seat.

        GENNARO
    Are they heavy?

        TIM
    Yeah.

        GENNARO
    Then they're expensive.  Put them back.

  He leans back and closes his eyes.  Tim ignores him and puts on
  the goggles.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Tim stares out the back window of the Explorer with Grant and
  Malcolm in it, behind them.  The image is bright fluorescent green.

        TIM
    Oh, cool!  Night vision!

  As Tim watches, the door of the rear Explorer opens, and a hand
  reaches out, holding an empty canteen out to catch some rain water.


60  IN THE REAR CAR

  Grant pulls the canteen back in, closes the door, and takes a
  drink.  He and Malcolm wait.

61  IN THE FRONT CAR

  Tim continues to stare out of the back window with the goggles.
  He swings his legs - - but suddenly stops.  He feels something.  He
  pulls off the goggles and turns back.  He moves into the back seat with
  Lex who is tapping her hat, and reaches forward to still her hand.

  BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.

        TIM
    Did you feel that?
      (or)
    Can you feel that?

  She don't answer.

  Tim leans over to the front passenger seat and looks at the two
  plastic cups of water that sit in the recessed holes on the dashboard.
  As he watches, the water in the glasses vibrates, making concentric
  circles - -

  - - then it stops - -

  - - and then it vibrates again.  Rhythmically.

  Like from footsteps.

  BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.

        GENNARO
      (not entirely convinced)
    What is that?  M-Maybe it's the power trying to come
    back on.

  Tim jumps into the back seat and puts the goggles on again.

        LEX
    What is that?

        GENNARO
    What is what?

  Tim turns and looks out the side window.  He can see the area
  where the goat is tethered.  Or was tethered.  The chain is still
  there, but the goat is gone.

  BANG!

  They all jump, and Lex SCREAMS as something hits the Plexiglas
  sunroof of the Explorer, hard.  They look up.

  It's a bloody, disembodied goat leg.

        GENNARO
    Oh, Jesus.  Jesus.

  Tim whips around to look out the side window again.  His mouth
  pops open, but no sound comes out.  Through the goggles, he sees an
  animal claw, a huge one, gripping the cables of the "electrified"
  fence.

  Tim whips the goggles off and presses forward, against the
  window.  He looks up, up, than cranes his head back further, to look
  out the sunroof.  Past the goat's leg, he can see - -

  - - Tyrannosaurus rex.  It stands maybe twenty-five feet high,
  forty feet long from nose to tail, with an enormous, boxlike head that
  must be five feet long by itself.  The remains of the goat hang out of
  the rex's mouth.  It tilts its head back and swallows the animal in one
  big gulp.

  Gennaro can't even speak.  His hand claws for the door handle,
  he shoulders it open, and takes off, out of the car.

        LEX
      (freaking out)
    He left us!  He left us alone!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
    He left us!  He left us!


62  ON THE ROAD,

  Gennaro runs away, as fast as he can, right past the second car,
  towards a cement block outhouse twenty or thirty yards away.

  He reaches it, ducks inside, and pulls the door after him - -

  - - but there's no latch, just a round hole in the unfinished
  door.  Gennaro backs into a stall, frantic.

  The whole bathroom begins to shake.

63  IN THE REAR CAR,

  Grant and Malcolm turn in the direction Gennaro went.

        GRANT
    Where does he think he's going?

        MALCOLM
    When you gotta go, you gotta go.

  Malcolm looks the other way, out the passenger window.  As he
  watches, the fence begins to buckle, its post collapsing into
  themselves, the wires SNAPPING free.

        MALCOLM
    What was that all about?  - -

  Grant now turns and watches as, ahead of them, the "DANGER!"
  sign SMACKS down on the hood of the first Explorer.  The entire fence
  is coming down, the posts collapsing, the cables SNAPPING as - -

  - - the T-rex chews its way through the barrier.

  They watch in horror as the T-rex steps over the ruined barrier
  and into the middle of the park road.  It just stands there for a
  moment, swinging its head from one vehicle to the other.

64  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  The rex strides around to the side of the car and peers down,
  from high above.  Tim leaps into the front seat and pulls the driver's
  door shut.  Both kids are terrified, breathing hard, unable to speak.

        TIM
    Please!  Please!

65  IN THE REAR CAR,

        MALCOLM
    Boy, do I hate being right all the time.

        GRANT
    Look at that!

  The T-rex turns and strides quickly back towards them.  It
  circles, slowly, bending over to look in at them through the window.

  Grant and Malcolm sit trembling in the front seat, watching as
  the giant legs stride past their windows.

        GRANT
    (a quivery whisper)
    Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on
    movement!

        MALCOLM
    You're sure?!

        GRANT
      (pause)
    Relatively.

  Malcolm freezes as the rex bends down and peers right in through
  his window.  The dinosaur's giant, yellowing eye is only slightly
  smaller than the entire pane of glass

  The T-rex pulls away slightly, then reaches down and BUMPS the
  car with its snout, rocking it.

66  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  Lex is rummaging around in the back cargo area, looking for
  something, anything.  She finds a flashlight.

67  ON THE ROAD,

  The front car lights up from within as Lex switches on the
  flashlight.

  The dinosaur raises its head.  It turns slowly from the second
  car to the first car, drawn by the light.  Making a decision, it
  strides over to the first vehicle.  FAST.

68  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  Tim and Lex can only stare out of the windows as the T-rex
  reaches their car and starts to circle it.

  The rex bends down and looks in through the front windshield,
  then the side window.  Tim is eye to eye with the thing for a second,
  then the dinosaur raises its head up, above the car.

        LEX
    I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -

        TIM
    Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!

  Tim climbs over the seat and joins Lex.

        TIM (cont'd)
    Where is the button then?

        LEX
    I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -

        TIM
    Why did you do this?

        LEX
    I don't know!  I'm sorry!

  The Kids look up, through the sunroof, as the head goes higher,
  and higher, and higher, and then the rex turns, looks straight down at
  them through the sunroof, opens its mouth wide and - -

  - - ROARS.

  The windows RATTLE, Lex SCREAMS, the flashlight goes on again,
  and the tyrannosaur strikes.

  SMASH!  The thing's head its the plastic sunroof, knocking the
  whole frame right out of the roof of the car and down into the vehicle.
  The bubble falls down onto Tim and Lex, trapping them, and the animal
  lunges down, through the hole, SNAPPING at them.

  The Plexiglas holds, though and protects Tim and Lex even as it
  pins them to the seats.  The T-rex continues to push down, and the
  glass GROANS, crack lines racing across it.

  Tim, whose feet were caught above him, pushes back, only an inch
  of glass between him and the dinosaur's teeth.

69  IN THE REAR CAR,

  Grant and Malcolm watch in horror as the dinosaur claws at the
  side of the vehicle with one of its powerful thigh legs.

  It pushes, starting to tip the car over.

        MALCOLM
    Oh my God!

        GRANT
    We gotta do something.

        MALCOLM
    What?  What can we do?

        GRANT
    There's gotta be something - -

  Grant looks around, climbs over the seat.  He tears apart the
  back area, searching - and finally finds a metal case.  He opens it,
  finding flares.  He grabs one and moves quickly back to the driver's
  seat and opens the door.

  Malcolm grabs a flare, too.

70  IN THE FRONT CAR,

  the glass windows SHATTER, the Kids are thrown to the side, and
  the Explorer tilts.

  The rex bends down and nudges the car with its head, rolling it
  up on its side.  Tim and Lex tumble around.

71  ON THE ROAD

  the T-rex starts to nudge the Explorer toward the barrier.  Over
  the barrier, there is a gentle terraced area at one side where the rex
  emerged from, but the car isn't next to that, it's next to a sharp
  precipice, representing a fifty or sixty foot drop.

  The car, upside down now, is pushed near the edge.

  The rex towers over the car.  Like a dog, its puts one foot on
  the chassis and tears a the undercarriage with its jaws.

  Biting at anything it can get a hold of, it rips the rear axle
  free, tosses it aside, and bites into a tire.

  The tire EXPLODES, startling the animal.

72  INSIDE THE CAR,

  Tim and Lex are trapped inside the rapidly flattening car.  As
  the frame continues to buckle, they crawl toward the open rear window,
  the car collapsing behind them.  Mud and rain water pout into what
  little space there is left.

  Tim is ahead, nearing the back window, when there is a CRUNCH
  and a seat comes down, pinning him.

73  ON THE ROAD,

  the dinosaur backs up, dragging the Explorer, swinging it left
  and right.  It seems ready to fling it over the edge.

  Grant gets out of his car.  He's holding the flare in one hand,
  which he pulls the top off of.  Bright flames shoot out the end of it.

        GRANT
    Hey!  Hey!  Over here!

  The T-rex turns and looks at him

  Grant waves the flare slowly in front of him from side to side.
  The T-rex follows his moving arm, eyes locked on the flare.  Grant
  looks over to the wall, and tosses the flare over the edge of the
  barrier.  The rex lunges after it - -

  Unclear with Grant's plan, Malcolm leaps out of the car and
  tries to scare up the T-rex's attention with his own newly lit flare.
  He begins to wave it at the animal.  Grant sees him - -

        GRANT
    Ian!  Freeze!  Freeze!  Get rid of the flare!

        MALCCOLM
    Get the kids!

  Malcolm inches back slowly, then takes off, running for his life
  down the road.  He runs to the cement block outhouse Gennaro went into
  earlier.

  The T-rex sees the movement.  It whirls and takes off after
  Malcolm, fast.

  Malcolm runs as fast as he can, approaching the outside just
  steps ahead of the T-rex

  But not far enough ahead.  Without even slowing down, the rex
  leans forward and flicks Malcolm into the air with its snout.

  It's just a nudge a for the rex, but it sends Malcolm sailing
  right through a wooden portion of the wall, and into the building.


74  IN THE RESTROOM

  Gennaro, who cowers in a corner, SCREAMS as teh head of the T-
  rex EXPLODES through the front of the building, sending chunks of
  cement flying in all directions inside.  The roof collapses; Gennaro
  tries to protect himself from the falling junk.


75  ON THE ROAD

  Grant gets on his feet and watches as the T-rex noses around in
  the rubble.

  It seems to find something.  It lunges, and Grant can hear
  Gennaro SCREAMING, the sound piercing - -

  - - until it abruptly stops.

  Grant scrambles over to the car.

        GRANT
    Tim!  Lex!

        LEX
    Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

  He lays on the ground, looking inside, and sees Lex staring up
  at him, conscious, her face covered in mud.

        GRANT
    Are you okay?  Can you move?
      (calling into the car)
    Tim!  Are you okay?

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -VERSION 1- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        GRANT
    Tim, are you okay?

        TIM
    I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!

        GRANT
    Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -VERSION 2- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        LEX
    He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr.
    Grant!  Daddy, daddy!

        GRANT
    Let's get you out.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Grant reaches in and drags her out.

        GRANT
    Are you okay?  Good girl.

  Grant tries to find Tim

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Tim?  Tim?

  Lex, staring over his shoulder, SCREAMS.  Grant whirls, covering
  her mouth at the same time.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Shhh!  Don't move!  It can't see us if we don't move.

  Lex looks at him like he's crazy, but freezes.  They wait.

  BOOM!  A big T-rex foot print smacks down in front of them as
  the dinosaurs approaches the car again.  It leans down, right past
  them, and SNIFFS the car, ragged bits of flesh and clothing hanging
  from its teeth.

  Not finding anything, the dinosaur swings its head away,
  SNORTING loudly through its nose.  Grant's hat flies off his head.
  Still, he doesn't move.

  The rex walks to the back of the car.  It bends down.

  WHAP!  The car spins as it is pushed from behind by the rex.
  Grant and Lex are pushed in front of it, helpless.  They scramble
  around on their knees, trying to keep ahead of the car, which the rex
  is now pushing even closer to the edge of the barrier.

  Grant and Lex crawl quickly, but the car is moving faster,
  catching up on them.


76  INSIDE THE CAR

  Tim awakens and SCREAMS.  He tries to untangle himself.


77  ON THE ROAD,

  the T-rex looms over Lex and Grant, who are trapped between the
  car and the sixty foot drop.


78  INSIDE THE CAR,

  the rex bends down and sees Tim.  Tim backs away, furiously, but
  there's almost no room to move in there.  The rex opens its mouth wide
  and stretches its tongue into the car.

  Tim screams and kicks as the tongue tries to wrap around him.
  But it fails, and withdraws from the car.


79  ON THE ROAD,

  the T-rex still tries to get to Grant and Lex, pushing the car,
  spinning on its roof.  Grant and Lex scramble, trying to avoid being
  caught by the T-rex and crushed by the car.

        GRANT
    This way!

  The back of the car almost crushes them against the barrier - -

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Get back!

  They move, as the rex continues to move the car towards the
  edge.  Grant finally gets on the wall, Lex follows.

  The T-rex ROARS in frustration.  It bends down for one final
  lunge at the car.

  Grant sees it coming.  He grabs one of the dangling fence cables
  on the other side of the barrier.

        GRANT
    Grab a hold of me!

  She wraps her arm around his neck.  He scrambles to the edge of
  the barrier, and starts to climb down.

        LEX
      (screaming)
    Timmy!  Timmy!

  The cable is slick with rain, and it's all Grant can do to hang
  on as he and Lex slide rapidly down.  Above them, the vehicle is now
  teetering over the edge, threatening to drop right on top of them if
  they didn't hurry.

  Grant GASPS, as Lex has unwittingly started to choke him as she
  holds on for dear life.

        GRANT
    You're choking me!

  The car GROANS, nearly over the edge now.  Grant looks to the
  side.  There are other cables, out of the line of the car's impending
  drop.  His feet scrambling along the concrete wall, Grant tries to
  swing over towards one.

        GRANT
    Grab a wire!

  But he falls short.  His momentum carries them back the other
  way, but on the second swing Lex manages to grab hold of the second
  cable.

        LEX
    I got it!

  The car falls.  Lex and Grant are clear by inches, clinging to
  the second cable.

        LEX
    Timmy!

  The car CRUNCHES into the leafy top of a tree, resting on its
  roof some fifteen feet below them.

  The T-rex stares down at them, but they are safely out of its
  reach.

  It ROARS once more, in a final fit of frustration, turns - -


A80 INT CONTROL ROOM  NIGHT

  JOHN HAMMOND is lived

        HAMMOND
    I will kill Nedry.  I will kill him.

  Muldoon bursts through the door.

        HAMMOND
      (to Muldoon)
    Well?

        MULDOON
    There's no sign of him anywhere.

  The game show music is louder and faster now, very annoying.

        HAMMOND
    Ray will you please switch off
      (or)
    stop that music?!

  RAY ARNOLD's cigarette is practically burning his lips, down to
  almost nothing in his mouth.  He hovers over NEDRY's computer terminal,
  which is a mass of incomprehensible commands that scroll by quickly as
  he futilely examines each one of them.

  MULDOON paces.  ELLIE stares at Arnold in amazement.

        ELLIE
  Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours?
  I mean, what's hanging us up?

        ARNOLD
  I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today.
  It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -

        ELLIE
      (stands, joins the group at the computer)
    What one?

  He points to his computer screen, to a specific series of
  commands.  The others crowed over his shoulder and stare at the screen.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    "Keycheck /space -o keycheck off safety -o."  He's
    turning the safety systems off.  He doesn't want
    anybody to see what he's about to do.  Now look at this
    next entry, it's the kicker.  "Wht.rbt.obj."  Whatever
    it did, it did it all.  But with Keycheck off, the
    computer didn't file the keystrokes.  Only way to find
    them now is to search the computer's lines of code one
    by one.

        ELLIE
    How many lines of code are there?

        ARNOLD
    Uh - - about two million.

        ELLIE
    Two million - - great.  That would help.
      (or)
    Oh good, that'll take no time.

        HAMMOND
    Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind
      (or)
    good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my
    grandchildren.

        MULDOON
    Sure.

        ELLIE
    I'm going with him.

  They head for the door.  Hammond turns, staring out the windows
  at the front of the control room.  He's gone pale, and he's sweating,
  wrapped up in million thoughts.  Behind him, Ray Arnold's voice calls
  to him, but he doesn't hear it.

        ARNOLD
    John - - John - -

  Hammond leans on his cane, and for the first time he looks like
  he's actually using it.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    John.

  Hammond turns, finally hearing him.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    I can't get Jurassic Park back on line without Dennis
    Nedry.


80  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  As the rain continues to pour down, a gas-powered jeep ROARS
  down another park road.


81  INT JEEP  NIGHT

  DENNIS NEDRY drives the jeep as fast as he can in the
  treacherous conditions.  He MUTTERS to himself, shaking his head.

        NEDRY
    Shoulda been there by now - - shoulda been there - -

  He hauls it around a corner and looks down, checking his watch.
  When he looks back up, his eyes go wide.

  There's a white wood guard rail fence, right in front of him.
  He stands on the brakes as hard as he can.  The jeep fishtails,
  skidding out of control in the mud towards the fence.

  Nedry hauls the wheel hard to the side to try to control the
  skid, but the jeep skids off the road, going halfway over the muddied
  embankment.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    God damn it!

  He drops the car in reverse and hits the gas.  The wheels spin,
  sending mud flying everywhere, but the jeep goes nowhere, just digs in
  further.

  Nedry can't believe it.  Frustrated, he gets out of the jeep.
  He stops suddenly - he can see another park road, down the sloping
  embankment, about twenty feet below.

  There is a large sign alongside the road.  Nedry leans forward
  excitedly to get a better look.  It reads "TO EAST DOCK."  He scrambles
  to the front of the jeep.

  ON THE HILLSIDE

  Nedry CRANKS a winch its coil on the front end of the jeep.

        NEDRY
      (mumbling to himself)
    No problem.  Winch this sucker off the thing - - tie it
    do a thing - - pull it down the thing - - and pull it
    back up.

  He loses his balance and slips - falling back on his rear.  He
  slides down the muddy embankment, across the road below.  Pissed, he
  gets to his knees and searches for his glasses.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Where are my glasses?  I can afford new ones.

  He stands and grabs the winch, and goes to a sturdy-looking tree
  on the other side.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    You can make it!

  From the distance, there is a soft HOOTING sound.  There's some
  movement in the bushes - Nedry looks around for the source of the sound
  and movement.  He doesn't find it.  He nervously checks his watch and
  goes back to the winch, but faster.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    No problem - - pop this thing right down - -

  The HOOTING comes again and Nedry turns - again, nothing.

  A figure ducks around the tree and pops out on the other side,
  HOOTING playfully.

  Nedry looks around one side of the tree - nothing.  It pops up
  on the other side, HOOTING again.  And Nedry looks again.  Nothing.  It
  seems like a friendly game of hide-and-seek.  But Nedry begins to get
  rattled.

        NEDRY
  That's nice.  Gotta go. I'm getting out of here.  C'mon
  you can make it!

  He secures the winch and starts across the road, back up the
  embankment.  He freezes, as he feels something behind him.  He turns
  around slowly and sees:

  A dilophosaur.  It stands only about four feet high, its spotted
  like an owl, and has a brilliant colored crest that flanks its head.
  It doesn't look very dangerous.  In fact, it's kind of cute.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Oh.  Uh - - nice boy.  Nice boy.  Okay. Run along.  I
    don't have anything for you!  Go on!    Go home!  Dinner
    time!  Are you hungry?  They'll feed you!  Go, boy.
    Girl.  Whatever.

  The dilophosaur just stares at Nedry, tilting its head
  curiously.  Nedry looks around on the ground and finds a stick.  He
  picks it up and chucks it at the thing.  He throws it as far as he can.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Nice juicy stick!  Fetch!

  The dilophosaur gets into the spirit of the game, but not the
  object.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Lame brain!  What's the matter with you?
      (or)
    What's the matter with you?

  He shakes his head and starts back towards the jeep, muttering
  to himself.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
  Walnut brain...extinct kangaroo...hope I run over you on
  the way down - -

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -??-OR-??- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    Walnut brain...extinct kangaroo...hope I run over you on
    the way down - -

  He's near the top when the dilophosaur suddenly hops out right
  in front him, startling him.  Nedry loses his balance and falls back,
  right on his rear.  He gets to his feet, angry.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    I said - -

  He picks up a stick and chucks it at the thing.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    - - beat it!

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    What are you do - -

  The animals HISSES.  The brightly colored fan around its neck
  flares wildly, two bulbous sacs on either side of its neck inflate.  It
  rears its head back again - -

  - - and it SPITS.

  SPLAT!  A big glob of something wet SMACKS into the middle of
  Nedry's chest.  He reaches down and touches the goo that's dribbling
  down his slicker.

        NEDRY (cont'd)
    That's disgusting!

  SPLAT!  Another glob of goo SMACKS into the highlight, right
  next to Nedry's head.

  He stands up.  A look of confusion crosses his face.  He lifts
  his right hand, the one that he touched the spit with, and looks at it
  strangely, flexing it.

  POW!  This time the lugie hits Nedry right smack in the face.
  He SCREAMS and rubs it away, frantically.

  Because it hurts.  Like hell.  Nedry falls back, clawing at this
  eyes, in excruciating pain.  He pulls his hands away, starting to
  hyperventilate.  He flails his arms in front of him, blinking a mile a
  minute, but blinded.

  He staggers forward, to try to get into the jeep.  He gets the
  door open, but SMACKS his head on the door frame and collapses.

  The can of shaving cream flies out of Nedry's jacket pocket - -
  and tumbles into runoff water, down the muddy hillside.  Nedry gets to
  his feet again and staggers in the general direction of the jeep.  He
  reaches the open door and feels his way in.  He SLAMS the door.

  There is another HOOT.  From inside the jeep.

  Nedry turns and SCREAMS.  The dilophosaur is right there, in the
  passengers seat.  It HISSES louder than before, its crest fans angrily,
  vibrating, reaching a crescendo - -

  - - and the thing pounces, SLAMMING Nedry back against the
  driver's window, SHATTERING it.  As Nedry shrieks - -

  Rain and mud wash over the shaving cream can, burying it.


82  OMITTED


83  EXT PARK GROUNDS  NIGHT

  The rain has all stopped now.  GRANT and LEX are at the bottom
  of the large barrier leading up to the park road.  Like it or not,
  they're in the park now, and are surrounded by think jungle foliage on
  all sides.  They're both beaten up, and Grant's face is covered in
  blood.

  He's bent over a big puddle, splashing water on his face,
  rinsing the blood off and trying to bring himself to.

  Poor Lex is scared as hell.  She stands behind Grant, ramrod
  straight, her breath coming short, desperate GASPS.  Her eyes are wide,
  and she doesn't look like she can move.

  As Grant gets rid of the blood, his injury doesn't look so bad,
  just a gash on his forehead.

  He turns and looks up to the tree the Explorer fell in.  It's
  stuck there, nose down in the thickest top branches.

  Lex's GASPS are getting louder.  She's terrified.

        GRANT
    Hey, come on, don't - - don't -- don't - - just - -just
    - - stop, stop.

  He touches her, but it's awfully awkward, more of a pat on the
  head than anything strong or reassured.

  But she responds to the contact, hurling herself forward and
  throwing her arms tightly around his waist.  She clamps here, holding
  on for dear life, SOBBING.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Lex, you gotta be quiet, please.  Stop it.  Shhhhh.

  This seems to quiet her.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Because if we make too much noise, he's going to hear us
    and come back.

  Lex bursts out crying again, a WAILING scream, nearly hysterical
  now.  Grant holds her, no idea what to do.  He turns and looks around.

        GRANT (cont'd)
      (a whispered shout)
    Timmy?!  Timmy!

  He hears a CRACKING sound.  He looks up to the tree again.  The
  Explorer has fallen a few feet lower into the branches.

  Grant looks down at Lex, who is sitting on a rock.

        LEX
    Dad - - Dad - -

        GRANT
  Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after
  you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to
  stay here and wait for me, okay?

        LEX
    He left us!  He left us!

        GRANT
    That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!

  Grant walks to the tree.  Lex scampers into the culvert.


84  EXT TREE  - NIGHT

  GRANT takes a deep breath. grabs hold of the first branch, and
  starts his long climb.  Fortunately, it's a good climbing tree, its
  branches thick and regularly spaced.

  Grant moves at a good pace.  He reaches the car's level, on the
  driver's side five or six feet to one side of it.

  The car's in rough shape.  It's much thinner that it use to be,
  its nose completely smashed in, the front wheels driven solidly into a
  thick branch.  They are what hold it in place.

        GRANT
    Tim?  Tim?

  Grant comes up to the car and looks in.  TIM is huddled on the
  floor on the passenger side, frightened, hugging his knees to his
  chest.

  He looks up at Grant with a tear and blood-streaked faced.  His
  voice is barely audible.

        TIM
    I threw up.

        GRANT
    That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.

  Tim doesn't move.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    I won't tell anybody you threw up.  Just give me your
    hand, okay?

  He reaches out.  Tim reaches too, but they're still about a foot
  apart.  Grant grabs hold of the steering wheel, to pull himself further
  in.  The wheel turns.

  On the branch, the front wheel turns, losing a bit of their grip
  on the thick branch they're resting on.

  Tim and Grant grab hands.  Grant holds on to him, getting an arm
  securely around his waist.  They climb down.  They stop on a branch.

        GRANT
    Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?

        TIM
    Yes it is.

        GRANT
  It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad
  ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

        TIM
    No.

        GRANT
    Me too.
      (he starts to move down)
    Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never,
    never look down, never.

        TIM
    This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it.
    This is...it's about fifty feet.

        GRANT
    So am I going to help you with your foot?

        TIM
    What if the car falls?
      (or)
    What if the wheels fall?

  The car GROWNS forward on the branch, which sags in their
  direction.  They look up.  The car begins to shift dramatically towards
  them.

        GRANT
    Oh, no!  GO, Tim, go!  Go!

  They climb down, as fast as they can, as the big branch that is
  supporting the car CREAKS, ready to give way any second.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Faster!  Faster!

  The branch breaks.  Disintegrates, really, and the car falls
  straight at them.

  Grant and Tim let go of the branch they're on and fall, THUDDING
  into another branch a few feet down.  The car SMACKS into the bug
  branch they just vacated, and stops there.

  Grant and Tim are half climbing, half falling down the tree now,
  slipping on the resin-covered branches, just trying like hell to get
  out of the way.

  CREEEE-POW!  The second branch breaks, and now the car SMASHES
  and CRASHES through a network of thinner branches, headed right for
  them.  It hits open space and goes into free fall.

  Grant turns, and puts up his arms in defense --

  -- and the car stops, SLAMMING into a thick branch just above
  him.

  Grant looks up, eyeball to eyeball with the front grill.

  The new branch starts to CREAK.

  Grant and Tim basically fall down the rest of the tree, the car
  BASHING its way through right behind them.  They jump the last six or
  seven feet and hit the ground, hard.

  Grant grabs Tim and rolls with him, to the side, just as the car
  SMASHES into the earth, nose first, standing upright that way.

  They look up in relief, but the damn thing's still heading for
  them, now tipping over, falling straight at them, and there's no way
  they have time to get out of the way this time, so Grant just balls
  himself up on top of Tim to try to protect him and --

  -- CRASH!  The jeep falls on top of them.  Grant, amazingly
  unhurt, looks up confused.

  They're inside the jeep again, saved by the hole sunroof.


  CUT TO:


85  EXT CULVERT - NIGHT

  LEX is still in the culvert, terrified, slowly BANGING her head
  against the wall.

  GRANT is at the mouth of the culvert, carefully studying the
  rinky-dink map of the park he picked up during the slide show.

        GRANT
    Okay -- okay --

  He's trying to get his bearings from the crude, cartoon-like
  drawing on the map, but it's tough.

  He looks up, picking a direction, and shoves the map in his
  pocket decisively.

  He looks back in at Lex.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Lex, you're going to have to get out of there.
      (he walks towards her)
    Hiding isn't a rational solution; we have to improve our
    situation.

  She doesn't move.  Grant looks at Tim.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Tim's out here.
      (Grant picks Tim up)
    He's okay.

  Still nothing.  Grant tries a new tact.

        GRANT
      (walking away)
    'Course you could just wait in there while we go back
    and get help.

        TIM
      (following Grant)
    That's a good idea.

        GRANT
    You'll probably be safe enough (alone) on your own --

        TIM
    I doubt it.

        GRANT
    Maybe -- it's hard to say.

        LEX
    Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!

        GRANT
    I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the
    drain, you know!

  She just stares at him like he's nuts.  Tim shakes his head at
  Grant, as if to say "nice try."  Grant calms his tone.

  - - - - - VERSION 1 - - - - -

        GRANT (cont'd)
    We can't go back the way we came.  What we have is a
    free-range T-rex on the road.  There's (there are)
    fences on either side.  If we meet him between here and
    the lodge, we'd have problems.  But what this means,
    what this means, is that this whole paddock is empty.
    It's safe.

        LEX
    It's safe?

        GRANT
    It's safe.

        LEX
    It's safe.

        GRANT
    Go (and) that's the way we're going to go.  What do you
    say?

        LEX
    Alright.

  - - - - - END - - - - -

  - - - - - VERSION 2 - - - - -

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Alright.  We're just going to walk back home.  Together.

  We walks over to Lex at the culvert and sits across from her.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    But we can't walk back on the road.  There are fences on
    either side.  And if we meet the Rex between here and
    the lodge we'd -- have problems.

  Lex covers her ears.  Grant tries to calm her.

        GRANT
    He's probably staked out the road as a feeding ground,
    which means this whole paddock is empty.  It's safe.
    It's safe, and that's the way we're going to go.  What
    do you say?

  - - - - - END - - - - -

  He's spoken calmly and confidently, so Lex crawls out of the
  culvert and stands next to him.

        GRANT
    Good girl.

  He kisses her hand and helps her crawl out of the culvert.

  Tim and Lex nod, and he starts off in the direction he
  indicated.  They trail behind him.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Might be kind of slow, but it can't be more than three
    or four miles.  I'd hoped the rex finished feeding by
    now, but let's not kid ourselves.  Did you know a
    carnivore can eat up to 25% of its body weight in
    (about) one sitting, so he's probably just ready to move
    on to the main course by now --

  He stops in the middle of the sentence, noticing he's alone.  He
  turns around.  Now both kids have scampered all the way back into the
  culvert, terrified.


86  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  MULDOON and ELLIE race down the park road in an open-topped jeep
  like the one Nedry took earlier.  Neither of them speak, they just
  stare ahead grimly, wondering what they're about to find.

        MULDOON
    There they are!

  They round a corner and come to the top of the hill, where the
  attack took place.  The jeep skids to a stop and they jump out.

  The road is rutted, muddy mess.  The cement block house is a
  pile of rubble.  One of the Explorers is gone, the other stands
  untouched, both doors hanging open.

        ELLIE
    Oh, God.  Where's the other car?

  She runs to the Explorer.  Muldoon follows, looking around.

  AT THE EXPLORER,

  Ellie leans in and looks around.  Nobody's there.  She and
  Muldoon walk towards the wreckage of the outhouse, calling out:

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    I think it's ahead of us.

        MULDOON
    It could be anywhere.  With the fences out, it can go in
    and out of any paddock it likes.

  They hear a MOANING sound from somewhere in the wreckage of the
  restroom building.  They rush over to it.

  IAN MALCOLM lies on his back, semiconscious among the twisted
  wood and cement.

        MULDOON
    It's Malcolm!

  He shines his light along the length of Malcolm's body.  His
  shirt is soaked with blood, but his right leg is even worse off.  The
  right ankle it bent outward at a strange angle from his leg, the
  trousers flattened, soaked with blood.

  Malcolm's belt has been twisted around his thigh.

        ELLIE
    He's put a tourniquet on.  Ian!  Ian!

  Malcolm GROANS as she touches him, groggy.

        MALCOLM
    Remind me to talk John for a lovely weekend.

  The T-rex ROARS again.  But closer now.  Ellie and Muldoon look
  at each other.

        ELLIE
    Can we chance moving him?

        MALCOLM
    Please - - chance it.

  Muldoon lays Malcolm as carefully as possible in the back of the
  jeep.

        MALCOLM
    Where are the kids?

  Ellie looks around.

        ELLIE
    Lex!  Tim!

  She turns and looks back at the empty road.  She's on the verge
  of tears, but is fighting them back.

        MULDOON
    Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People
    just disappear.  No blood, no trace.    That's the way it
    happens.

        ELLIE
    No, no, no!

  She walks to the edge of the road, her eyes following the deep
  ruts the Explorer made when it went over the edge.  Muldoon gets ready
  to leave.

        MULDOON
    Ellie, com one!!

        ELLIE
    The other car!


87  EXT CLEARING  NIGHT

  ELLIE's and MULDOON's flashlight beams spray light by the base
  of the tree.

        MULDOON
    Dr. Grant!

        ELLIE
    Alan!

  They find the wrecked Explorer.  Muldoon peers inside, looking
  for anything.

        ELLIE
    Do you see anything?

        MULDOON
    I don't know.

  The T-rex ROARS again, closer still

  Ellie nervously goes to the other side of the car and looks in.

        ELLIE
    Alan?!

        MULDOON
    They're not here.

  Ellie desperately searches the ground for any signs of Grant.
  She finds their footprints.

        ELLIE (O.S.)
    Thank God.


88  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  MALCOLM, laid out in the back of the jeep, feels something
  strange.  He looks down, at the one of the T-rex footprints in the
  road.  It's filled with water.

  The water in the puddle vibrates rhythmically.

  Malcolm's eyes widen.  He looks around, frantically.

        MALCOLM
    Uh - - anybody?  Anybody hear that?


89  EXT CLEARING  NIGHT

  ELLIE is still looking around, to MULDOON's chagrin.  Her
  flashlight falls on three sets of footprints in the mud.

        ELLIE
    Look!

  Wit her flashlight, she follows the trail the footprints made.
  They lead into the jungle and disappear.


90  EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT

  MALCOLM's staring , wide-eyed, at the rings in the water, which
  are getting bigger now.

        MALCOLM
    It's a - - an impact tremor is what it is, it, uh - -

  BOOM.  BOOM.

        MALCOLM (cont'd)
    I'm fairly alarmed here!

  ELLIE and MALCOLM come up over the embankment, excited.

        MALCOLM
    Gotta move, gotta get out of here.  Let's go - we gotta
    go, we gotta get out of here, right now!  Go, go!  Let's hurry, let's
    get out of here!

  They stop talking.  The BOOMING is louder now, and faster.  Much
  faster.  They look back, over their shoulders.

        ELLIE
    Oh.

  Ellie and Muldoon get into the jeep, Muldoon in the driver's
  seat.

        MALCOLM
    Move now!  Let's go, let's go, right now, right now!

  The tyrannosaur SMASHES out of the jungle foliage, bursts onto
  the road, and runs straight at them, moving at least thirty miles an
  hour.

        MALCOLM
    GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO!

  Muldoon fumbles for the keys, turns the jeep over, and SLAMS it
  into gear.  He drops the clutch, hits the gas, and tears ass out of
  there.

  But the jeep is slow to work through the first few gears.
  Terrified, Ellie dares to look down, to the side view mirror, which
  tells her "Objects Are Closer Than They Appear."

  And they sure are.  The T-rex is still gaining on the slowly
  accelerating jeep.  All three of them stare back at the rex in terror -
  -

        ELLIE
    Faster, faster!

        MALCOLM
    Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!

        ELLIE
    Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!

        MALCOLM
    Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear!
    Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th
    gear, go!

  - - which means they don't see the half-fallen tree branch right
  in front of them, blocking the path of the road.  Muldoon looks back
  first, SHOUTS - -

        MULDOON
    DOWN!

  - - they all duck.

  The windshield hits the branch and SHATTERS as the jeep flies
  ahead, really picking up speed now.

  The T-rex just runs right through the branch, SMASHING it
  entirely.

  They're bounced around pretty badly.  Malcolm is knocked into
  the front, and in so doing knocks the gear shift into neutral.  The
  engine RACES, the T-rex closes in again - -

  Losing ground now, the dinosaur makes a final lunge for the jeep
  and CRUNCHES into the left rear quarter panel - -

        ELLIE
    Faster, faster!

  - - but Muldoon SLAMS it back into gear and guns it.  The T-rex
  gives up, fading into the distance.

  They drive in silence for a few moments, all scared out of their
  wits.

        MALCOLM
    Think they'll have that on the tour?


91  EXT PARK GROUND NIGHT

  GRANT, LEX, and TIM make their way through Jurassic Park.  Far
  in the distance, there's another ROAR.  Grant hears it, but tries not
  to show it.

        LEX
    Hear that?
      (or)
    Are you hearing this?

        GRANT
    No, I didn't hear anything.
      (or)
    No, we're okay.

  They keep walking, but now Grant is looking around for a safe
  place to hide.  He looks up, to the towering trees around them.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    You (guys) both look pretty tired.  I think
      (or)
    why don't we find
      (or)
    we ought to find someplace to rest.

  He hears another ROAR

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Like about now.  C'mon!  Hurry up!  Like this tree.

        LEX
    Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?

        TIM
    What if we fall?  I hate trees.


92  EXT TREE  NIGHT

  LEX, TIM, and GRANT climb.  Grant is behind, watching the other
  two, giving them a push up when they need it.

        TIM
    I hate trees!

        LEX
    They don't bother me.

        TIM
    Yeah, you weren't in that last one.

  Now, near the top of the tree, the three of them sit there,
  dangling their legs, looking out over the park.

  It's an incredible view.  They can see in all directions.  And
  with the full moon, there's a lot of detail.

  Most striking of all are dozens of sauropod heads, at the end of
  long necks, that tower over the park.

        TIM (cont'd)
    Hey!  Those are brontosauruses - - I mean, those are
    brachiosauruses.

        GRANT
    It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great
    name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".

        TIM
      (digging that)
    "Thunder lizard!"

  Grant finds a solid web of branch and settles himself in it,
  leaning back against the trunk of the tree, with a little room on
  either side of him. Lex nestles up next to him on the branch.  Grant is
  surprised, but accepts it.

  Tim climbs off to the side, to a nook in the branch of his own.
  Silent of a moment, the three can hear the HOOTS of the animals as they
  call.  Some are almost musical.

        GRANT
    Listen to that!  They're singing!
      (he moves over to a higher branch)
    Of course no one's ever heard one from a dinosaur
    before, but - - I could swear that sounds  suspiciously
    to me like a mating call (to me).  In an all-female
    environment - -
      (or)
    On an all-girl island?

  He smiles, enchanted.  He HOOTS himself, trying to imitate one
  of the calls.  Immediately, five or six of the heads turn in their
  direction and HOOT back.

        LEX
    No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the
    monsters come over here!

        LEX
    They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And
    these are herbivores.

        TIM
    That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I
    think they'd make an exception.

        GRANT
    Tim, Tim, Tim....

        LEX
    Oh, I hate the other kind.

        GRANT
    They're just doing what they do.
      (or)
    Well the other kind - -
      (he gets off the branch and goes back to sit with
      the kids)
    - - just do what they do.

        LEX
    Dorkatops!

        TIM
    Straight-A brainiac!

        GRANT
    Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -

  Satisfied, Tim settles in for the night.  Grant shifts too,
  getting comfortable, but something in his pocket pinches him.  He
  winces and digs it out.  It's the velociraptor claw he unearthed so
  long ago in Montana

  Yesterday, actually.  He looks at it, thinking a million
  thoughts, staring at this thing that used to be so priceless.

        LEX
    What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of
    dinosaur bones any more?

        GRANT
    I guess we'll just have to evolve too.

        TIM
    What do you call a blind dinosaur?

        GRANT
    I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?

        TIM
    A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind
    dinosaur's dog?

        GRANT
    You got me.

        TIM
    A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.

  Grant laughs.  Both kids finally close their eyes, but after a
  moment, Lex pops hers open again.

        LEX
    What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?

        GRANT
    I'll stay awake.

        LEX
      (skeptical)
    All night?

        GRANT
    All night.

  Grant lets the claw fall to the ground.


93  OMITTED


94  INT RESTAURANT  NIGHT

  ELLIE comes into the darkened restaurant, following the source
  of the flickering light.  A candle burns at a table in the corner.

  JOHN HAMMOND sits at the table, alone.  There is a bucket of ice
  cream in the middle, and he's eating a dish of it, staring down
  morosely.

  Ellie draws up to the table and Hammond looks up at her.  His
  eyes are puffy, his hair is messed up - - for the first time we've seen
  him, the fire is gone from his eyes.

        HAMMOND
    They were all melting.
      (or)
    It was all melting.

  Ellie just nods.

        ELLIE
    Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.

        HAMMOND
    They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children
    through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

  Ellie nods.  Another pause.  Hammond breaks it again.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    You know the first attraction I ever built when I came
    down south from Scotland?  Was a Flea Circus, Petticoat
    Lane.  Really quite wonderful. We had a wee trapeze, a
    roundabout - - a merry-go - - what you call it?

        ELLIE
    Carousel.

        HAMMOND
    A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized
    of course, but people would swear they could see the
    fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the
    fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade...
      (he trails off)

    Ellie just looks at him, not sure what his state is.  He goes
    on.

        HAMMOND
    But with this place, I - - I wanted to give (show) them
    something real, something that wasn't an illusion,
    something they could see and (feel) touch.  An aim
    devoid of (without) merit.

        ELLIE
    But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel
    it.

        HAMMOND
    You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring
    Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.    We're over-
    dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's
    all correctable for the next time around.

        ELLIE
    John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea
    Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by
    what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.


        HAMMOND
    (When) Once we have control again we - -

        ELLIE
    Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by
    the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I
    didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out
    now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces.
    John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing
    that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and
    Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying
    - - people are dying, you know?

  There is a long pause.  Hammond avoids her gaze.  Ellie reaches
  out and takes a spoon out of one of the buckets of ice cream, and licks
  it.  Finally:

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    It's good.

  He looks up at her, and his face is different, as the unhappy
  irony of what he's about to say finally hits home.

        HAMMOND
    Spared no expense.


95  OMITTED


96  EXT PARK  DAWN

  The sun comes up over Jurassic Park.  The danger of the night
  before is overcome by the sheer beauty of the place - - it really is
  like the Serengeti Plain.

  Over at the edge of a great open field, a huge tree marks the
  border between the open area and the thick of the jungle.

  UP IN THE TREE,

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX are asleep in the branches of the tree, both
  kids now curled up under Grant's arms.

  A heavy shadow falls over all three of them, blocking out the
  sun entirely.  Grant awakens, only a little bit asleep, as - -

  - - a brachiosaur's head pushes into the tree branches, right up
  beside them.  It hesitates there for a second, seemingly staring at
  them.  Grant just watches as it opens its mouth very wide and CHOMPS
  down on a branch over their heads.

  The kids awaken with a start.  Tim points, Lex opens her mouth
  to scream, but nothing comes out.  Then - -

        LEX
    Go away!

        GRANT
      (quietly)
    It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!

        TIM
    Veggiesaurus, Lex, Veggiesaurus!

  But Lex isn't taking any chances and scrambles back, away from
  its mouth.  Tim and Grant come together on the branch, just staring at
  the dinosaur in wonder as it eats its breakfast.

  Grant gets another branch.

  Tim scampers up, trying to get the brachiosaur's attention.

        TIM (cont'd)
    Come here, boy - - I mean girl.
      (he tries  whistling)

  Grant moves forward and tries to feed the brachiosaur.  The
  animal gets the end of the branch and starts a tug-of-war with Grant.

  Tim tries to help him - - they really begin to have a good time
  with the brachiosaur.

  HONK!  The brachiosaur makes a loud honking noise, startling
  Grant and the kids.

        GRANT
    Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.

        TIM
    It's so strong!  Look at its nose.
      (he grabs onto the branch)
    Need help?

  Tim reaches out, petting the dinosaur's head while it chews.

        TIM (cont'd)
    That's a girl.  Hey Lex, you can touch it.  It's a girl,
    just like you.  Come on, it's okay.  Lex, come on and
    touch it.  It likes you.  It's gotta like you.  Come on
    Lex.  Lex, come over and touch - - it's a girl, it has
    to like you.  Lex, why don't you touch it.  It has to
    like you.  It's a girl.

        GRANT
    Come on, try some.  Take a bite.

        TIM
    It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch
    it?  Look at his nose.

        GRANT
    This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex!
    Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?
      (he moves in closer)
    Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal.
    Just think of it as a big cow!

  Grant maneuvers in closer.  He reaches out and grabs hold of the
  thing's lip with both hands and pulls it down, revealing the jaw at
  work.

        LEX
    I like cows.

        GRANT
    You're a beautiful big animal.

        TIM
    His nose is running.  It looks like it has a cold.

  The dinosaur keeps chewing, not objecting to the inspection.

        TIM
    Did you smell that?

  Lex tentatively edges forward in the tree to the inspection.

        LEX
    Come on girl, up here.

  She barely touches the thing on the tip of its nose - -

  - - and it SNEEZES.  It's a vast explosion, and Lex falls back,
  dripping wet from head to toe.

        TIM
    God bless you!


96A OMITTED


97  ON THE GROUND,

  Lex, her shirt is soaked, and face all wet, walks away from the
  tree.  Tim and Grant follow.

        TIM
    Oh, great.  Now she'll never try anything new!

  Lex is embarrassed and ticked off.

        TIM (cont'd)
    She'll just sit in her room and never come out and play
    with her computer - -

        LEX
      (as she wipes off some of the wet and throws it
      at Tim)
    I'm a hacker!

        TIM
    That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you
    people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!

  Tim and Lex continue talking, oblivious to Grant, who has
  stopped by  a tree root trunk.

        TIM
    Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!
      (or)
    Hey Lex, com here.

        LEX
    What?

        TIM
    Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.

  Grant is still crouching on the ground below the tree where he
  landed, staring at something in the palm of his hand.  They both come
  and look over his shoulder, curious.  They stare in amazement - -

  - - at a whole clutch of dinosaur eggs!  All hatched, now empty.
  Grant picks up one of the fragments, a large one - nearly half an egg.

        GRANT
    You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The
    dinosaurs are breeding.

        TIM
      (taking the shell from him)
    But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.

        GRANT
    Amphibian DNA.

        LEX
    What's that?

        GRANT
    Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA
    to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the
    dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of
    frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to
    spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a
    single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life
    found a way!


98  INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  The mood in the room is hopeless.  MALCOLM, his wounds bandaged,
  but in real pain, hangs around with ELLIE and MULDOON, hoping for some
  development while RAY ARNOLD is still at the computer terminal and
  looking a mess, he doggedly sorts through the computer system's lines
  of code.  One.  By one.  By one.  They BLIP by, reflected in his
  glasses.  He turns and stares up at HAMMOND with a look of absolute
  incredulity on his face.

        ARNOLD
    No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's
    absolutely out of his mind - -

        ELLIE
    Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?

  Hammond turns to her, the twinkle back in his eye.

        HAMMOND
    We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which
    is the only option left to us.  We will never find the
    command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well,
    and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So
    shutting down the system - -

        ARNOLD
    I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else,
    because I will not.

        HAMMOND
    - - shutting down the system is the only way to
    guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand
    correctly, all the system will come back on their
    original start-up modes correct?

        ARNOLD
    Theoretically, yeah (yes), but we've never shut down the
    whole system.  It may not come back at all.

        ELLIE
    But would we get the phones back?

        ARNOLD
    Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -

        MULDOON
      (desperate)
    What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that
    into effect!

        ELLIE
    What's that?

        HAMMOND
    It's absolutely out of the question.

  Hammond walks away from the group.

        ARNOLD
    The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
    spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
    island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene
    that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.
    Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless
    they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll
    go into a coma and die.

        ELLIE
    How would we cut off the lysine?

        ARNOLD
    No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving
    them unattended.

  Malcolm speaks up.

        MALCOLM
    How soon before they become comatose?

        ARNOLD
    It would be totally painless - - they'd just slip into
    unconsciousness and they die.

        MALCOLM
    How long before they slip into unconsciousness?

        ARNOLD
    About - - seven days, more or less.

        ELLIE
    Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - -
    clever.

        MALCOLM
    That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die
    together.  John's plan.
      (he raises a hand)

  Hammond finally loses his cool. He BELLOWS, summoning every
  ounce of authority at his command.  And that's quite a bit.

        HAMMOND
    PEOPLE ARE DYING!

  There is a moment in which no one dares to speak.  Hammond
  regains himself.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    Will you please shut down the system.

  Arnold swallows and gets to his feet.

        ARNOLD
    You asked for it - -

  He walks slowly across the room to a red metal box on the wall.
  He takes a key from his belt, unlocks the door, and opens it.

  There is a row of four switches inside.  He flips them off, one
  by one, leaving only a single lever left.

  His hand hovers over it. . . and he flips the lever.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    - - and you got it.

  Every monitor, every terminal, every fluorescent light shuts
  out. plunging them into near-darkness.

  They just sit in eerie stillness for a moment.

        ELLIE
      (hushed voice)
    How long will this take?

        ARNOLD
    'Bout thirty seconds.

  They wait, in tense silence.  Hammond adjusts the wilting silk
  handkerchief in his breast pocket.  He notices Malcolm staring at him,
  his eyes full of disapproval.

        HAMMOND
    I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you
    think all that much of me now, do you?

        MALCOLM
    You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't
    have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You
    think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't
    see the consequences.  You're very good at solving
    problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know
    the right questions.

        ELLIE
    Ian - -

  Malcolm looks at her.

        MALCOLM
    Yes?

        ELLIE
    - - shut up.

        MALCOLM
    Yes.
      (to Hammond)
    It's not a criticism, by the way.

  Finally, Arnold turns back to the box.  He flips the row of
  safety switches back again, then hesitates by the main switch.

        ARNOLD
    Hold on to your butts.

  He throws it.  And nothing happens. There is a very long pause.

        MALCOLM
    It's not working.

        ARNOLD
    Uh - -

        MULDOON
    Listen, which of you knows how to handle a gun?

  Arnold, who can't quite understand this, races over to the main
  monitor

        ARNOLD
      (joyously)
    HAH!  It's okay!  It's okay!  Look!  See that?!  LOOK!

  They stare at the monitor, which glows with a faint amber light,
  the only mechanical thing in the room that's on.  The left hand corner
  of the screen displays two words - -

  /system ready.

  Arnold looks at them, his face triumphant.

        ARNOLD (cont'd)
    It's on!  It worked!

        HAMMOND
    That will teach you to trust Grandpa.

        MALCOLM
    Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything
    is still off!

        ARNOLD
    The shutdown must have tripped the circuit breakers.
    All we have to do is turn them back on, reboot a few
    systems in here - - the phones, security doors, half a
    dozen others - - but it worked!  System ready!

        MULDOON
    Where are the breakers?

        ARNOLD
    Out in the maintenance shed.  Other side of the
    compound.  I'll go out there.  Three minutes, and I can
    have the power back on in the entire park.

        HAMMOND
    Just to be safe, I'd like to have everybody in the
    emergency bunker until Mr. Arnold returns, and the whole
    system is back on its feet again.


  CUT TO:


A99 EXT COMPOUND  DAY

  MULDOON and ELLIE carry a Gerry rigged stretcher with MALCOLM on
  it down a narrow path in the compound.  HAMMOND is with them.


  CUT TO:


96D EXT PARK GROUNDS  DAY

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX walk through the park grounds, heading
  across a relatively open area. Grant consults the map.

        TIM & LEX
    I'm tired, and I'm hungry.  When I get back I'm gonna
    have peanuts and...etc.

        GRANT
    The visitor's center should be just about a mile beyond
    that rise.  If we keep - -

  The ANIMAL CRY they heard earlier is closer now, louder, and
  repeated by many more animals.  Grant looks up.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    What is that? Can you tell me what they are?

        TIM
    Gallimimus.

  He turns around, to face the direction the sound is coming from.
  He squints.  The ANIMAL CRY are much louder now, accompanied by a low
  rumble.

        TIM (cont'd)
    Here - - they're flocking this way.

  Grant takes a few steps forward.  As he watches, he can make out
  shapes in the distance.

  Dinosaurs.  Dozens of them.  All at once, he figures it out.

        GRANT
    STAMPEDE!

  And that's exactly what it is, a stampede of at least forty
  dinosaurs, Gallimimus by name.  Lex is ready to get out of there, but
  Grant and Tim hesitate, staring.

  The dinosaurs kick up a flock of birds, which startles them, and
  they call change direction at once, the same way.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Look at the wheeling - - the uniform direction change!
    Like a flock of birds evading a predator!

  Sure enough, they hear a ROAR, the very familiar roar - -
  - - of Tyrannosaurus rex.

        GRANT
    Oh, shit.

  Grant and the kids whirl at the sound, but can't place it, as it
  seems to come from all around them.  They look back towards the
  stampede.  The herd spontaneously changes direction again, and now
  they're headed straight at them.

  The three of them take off, across the meadow, toward the
  relative cover of the jungle.  It's a real footrace, but the herd is
  far faster, and Grant knows they're not going to make it.

  They jump over a huge root network.  There's a space under it to
  hide, and Grant stops the kids, shoves them underneath, then follows
  them.  They cover their heads as the herd THUNDERS over the roots.

  Chunks of everything fly everywhere as the herd plows overhead,
  their clawed feet striking the roots dangerously close to Grant and the
  kids.

  Finally, they pass. Grant peers up, over the top root.  He looks
  toward the trees, which the herd is now running alongside.

  A ROAR comes from somewhere within the trees.

  Grant scans the trees, looking for any sign of the T-rex - -

  - - and then it bursts out, ahead of the herd, cutting them off,
  throwing them into disarray, scattering them everywhere.

  They all stare as the rex kicks it into overdrive, runs down one
  of the Gallimimus, and sinks its teeth into its neck.

  The T-rex makes the kill in a cloud of dust and debris.

  Tim and Grant half rise to their feet, staring in wonder.

        LEX
    I wanna go - -now!

  But Grant and Tim are transfixed, watching the T-rex.

        GRANT
    Watch how it eats!

        LEX
    Please!

        GRANT
    Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!

    Tim nods in fascination.  The T-rex pauses in the middle of its
    meal and ROARS.

        LEX
    Let's go!

        GRANT
    Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.

  She turns and takes off, running as fast as she can, across the
  open plain.  Tim and Grant tear themselves away and follow her.

        TIM
    Look at all it's blood!

100 INT BUNKER  DAY

  ELLIE paces impatiently.  She comes down the stairs.

        ELLIE
    Something's happened.  Something went wrong.

  MULDOON paces too.  HAMMOND and MALCOLM are also crammed in the
  underground bunker.  Malcolm lays on a table, while Hammond tries to
  tend to his wounds.

  Hammond speaks, still feeling the obligation of the host.

        HAMMOND
    This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major
    theme parks have had delays.  When they opened
    Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.

        ELLIE
    John....

        MALCOLM
    But, John.  But if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks
    down, the pirates don't eat the tourists.

  Another pause.  More pacing.

        ELLIE
    I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going
    to go get the power back on.

        MULDOON
    You can't just stroll down the road, you know.

        HAMMOND
    Bob, let's not be too hasty.  He's only been gone - -
      (he looks at his watch)

  Muldoon walks over to a steel cabinet.  Ellie joins him.

        MULDOON
    I'm going with you.

        ELLIE
    Okay.

  Muldoon CLANGS open a steel cabinet, revealing an impressive
  array of weaponry inside.  He removes a shotgun and what looks like a
  small rocket launcher.  He shoves a shell into the barrel of the rocket
  launcher, which accepts it with a faint electronic SIZZLE.

  Hammond searches out the set of blueprints, gets them out of the
  file cabinet and spreads them out on top of Malcolm almost crushing his
  leg.

        HAMMOND
    Sorry.

  Ellie and Muldoon join Hammond.

        HAMMOND (cont'd)
    This isn't like switching on the kitchen light, but I
    think I can follow this and talk you through it.

  Hammond signals with a look.

        ELLIE
    Talk.
      (or)
    Right.
      (or)
      (nothing)

  Ellie gets a couple of walkie-talkies from the shelf and shoves
  them in her belt.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    Okay.

        HAMMOND
    But you know, I should  really be the one going (to go).

        ELLIE
    Why?

        HAMMOND
    Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -

        ELLIE
    Look.

        MULDOON
    Come on, let's go.

        ELLIE
    We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get
    back.
      (she backs towards the door)
    You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on
    channel two.


  CUT TO:


101 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX scrambles through the jungle, completely out
  of breath, exhausted.  They arrive at the base of the big electrical
  fence that surrounds the main compound.

  Grant looks up at the fence.  It must be over twenty feet high.

        GRANT
    It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?

        TIM
    Nope.

        LEX
    Way too high.

  Grant grabs a stick and climbs up on the ledge.  He looks at the
  warning light on the fence.  It's out.  He pokes the wire with a stick.
  No sparks fly

        GRANT
    Well, I guess that means the power's off.

  Still not trusting the fence, he taps it with his foot.  He
  moves in slowly and lays both hands on a cable and closes his fingers
  around it.

  Grant's body shakes!  He SCREAMS.  The kids SCREAM!  He stops,
  and turns around slowly...and smiles wickedly.

        LEX
    That's not funny.

        TIM
    That was great!

  Far in the distance, the T-rex ROARS.  Without a second's delay,
  both kids leap to their feet.


  CUT TO:


102 EXT BUNKER  DAY

  ELLIE and MULDOON step out of the bunker.

  The main compound feels different now - - it belongs more to the
  jungle than to civilization.  Muldoon has the big gun in his hands.

        ELLIE
      (on the radio)
    Okay, I'm on channel two.

        MULDOON
    Stick to my heels.

  They start down the path, moving quickly.


102A  EXT PATH  DAY

  MULDOON and ELLIE emerge from one path and come into a slightly
  more open area.  The huge raptor pen stands silently, surrounded and
  penetrated by jungle, the abandoned goon toward looming over it like a
  haunted house.

  Muldoon slows down, Ellie right next to him.  They notice a hole
  in the fence that surrounds the raptor pen.

  The metal is twisted, as if gnawed, the hole is large enough for
  an animal to slip through.

        ELLIE
    Oh my God.  Aw, God.

        MULDOON
  The shutdown must have turned off all the fences.
  Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the
  raptor fence.


103

  He squats near the hole, looking at the ground.  He sees three
  sets of footprints. He follows them with his eyes.  They head off in
  different directions, but all in the jungle foliage on either side of
  them.

        MULDOON
    C'mon on, this way.

        ELLIE
    I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!

  Muldoon walks slowly, as if he heard something.

        MULDOON
    No. We can't.

        ELLIE
    Why not?

        MULDOON
    Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight
    ahead.

  Ellie turns, very slowly, to face the bushes.  At first, she
  doesn't see anything, but then there's something very faint, like a
  shifting of the light, and a shadow seems to move in the bush, RUSTLING
  the leaves.

        MULDOON
    It's all right.

        ELLIE
    Like hell it is!

  Muldoon raises his weapon slowly to his shoulder.

        MULDOON
    Run, towards the shed.  I've got her.

  Ellie backs up, down the path, slowly. Muldoon follows behind
  her, keeping his gun trained in the bushes. The shadow in the bushes
  moves too, at an even pace with them.

        MULDOON
    Go!

  Ellie, startled, turns and falls over a log.  She quickly stands
  and starts to run towards the shed.  Muldoon walks slowly into the
  bushes.

  ON THE PATH,

  Ellie runs as fast as she possibly can - - a real broken field
  sprint, hopping over branches, flying across the open area at top
  speed.  Over a log - - SPLASH!, she hits a water puddle.  She comes to
  another log obstacle - - she grabs a tree and swings over it.

  She nears the maintenance shed, and doesn't look back. She
  reaches the door, blasts through it, and SLAMS it behind her.


  CUT TO:


104 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  A hand comes into the foreground and takes a firm grip on one of
  the tight fence cables.  Another hand follows it, then a third.

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX climb over the fence, pulling themselves up
  by the tension wires, crawling right past a "DANGER!" sign that tells
  them this fence ought to be electrified.


105 INT BUNKER  DAY

  MALCOLM and HAMMOND hover over a complex diagram of the
  maintenance shed that's spread out in front of them.  Hammond clutches
  the radio in his hand, almost praying to it.

  Finally, it CRACKLES.

        ELLIE (o.s.)
    I'm in.  Mr. Arnold?  Mr. Arnold?


106 INT MAINTENANCE SHED  DAY

  ELLIE is at the doorway of the maintenance shed, breathing hard
  from fear, listening to Hammond's VOICE on the radio

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    Great.  Good.  Okay - - ahead of you should be a metal
    stairway.  Go down it.

  Ellie does, heading into the room, shining the flashlight ahead
  of her.  There is a maze of pipes. ducts, and electrical work on both
  sides of her.

108 INT SHED  DAY

  ELLIE walks straight ahead from the bottom of the metal stairs.

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
  Right.  After twenty or thirty feet, you'll come to a T
  junction. Take a left.

        MALCOLM (o.s.)
    John. just have her follow the main cable - -

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    I understand how to read a schematic.

  Ellie keeps walking, nervous as hell.  She looks around.
  Awfully dark down here.

        ELLIE
    Going down the stairs...okay... damn it!  Dead end!

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    Wait a minute, wait a minute, there was a right back
    there somewhere - -

        MALCOLM (o.s.)
      (taking over)
    Ellie?!  Look above you - - there should be a large
    bundle of cable and pipes all leading in the same
    direction!  Follow that!

  Ellie looks up, finds the bunch of cables, and follows it into a
  main corridor.

        ELLIE
      (into the radio)
    Piping...okay... following the piping.  It goes back up
    the stairs and across the stairs... following the
    stairs.

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    Look for a metal grate and that to it's longest
    direction.
      (*ADDED DIALOGUE, NOT RECORDED)

        ELLIE
    Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the
    grating.

        HAMMOND
    Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a
    big, gray box.

        ELLIE
    Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a
    passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could
    you guys talk a little bit to me?

      (NOTE:  DIALOGUE TO BE ADDED, WASN'T RECORDED - - Steven
      Spielberg wants Malcolm to say something funny to Ellie over the radio;
      she smiles)

  Walking fast Ellie follows the tubing to the end of the
  corridor, where she sees just a box.

        ELLIE
      (into the radio)
    Okay - - I see the gray box.

  Ellie goes through a mesh gate and walks towards the gray box.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    It says "High Voltage".

  She pushes the door open even further, revealing a vast array of
  breakers and switches inside.

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    Now, Ellie, you can't just throw the main switch by
    hand, you have to pump up the primer handle to give you
    a charge. It's a large, flat, gray - -

        ELLIE
    I see it!


109 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  GRANT and the KIDS swig over the top of the fence and start
  their climb down.


110 INT SHED  DAY

  ELLIE pumps the gray handle, which is sluggish.  Above it, a
  small white indicator CHINGS over the "discharged" to "charged".  Ellie
  SLAMS the gray lever back into positions.

        ELLIE
    It's charged, okay!

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
    Right (good)!  Now, under the words "contact position"
    there's a round green button that says "push to close!"
    Push it!

  Ellie does.  The "contact position" light CHINGS over to
  "closed" and lights start to go on all over the panel.

  Did I do it?  Is the power back on?


111 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  GRANT and LEX continue to climb down the fence.  Tim is having
  difficulty - - just as he's about to take another step, he loses his
  footing and almost falls... but then regains control and hangs on.


112 INT SHED  DAY

  ELLIE watches as the column of twelve white indicator lights
  flash on the control panel.  They are clearly labeled, each one for a
  different area of the park.

        HAMMOND (o.s.)
  Now Ellie, the red buttons turn on the individual park
  systems.  Switch them on.

  As Ellie punches the buttons, they light up... and our eyes go
  to near the end of the row.

  It's marked "Perimeter Fence."


113 INT JUNGLE  DAY

  GRANT lets go, dropping the last few feet to the ground.  LEX
  does the same.

  A warning light begins to flash, coming back to life.  Grants
  eyes go wide.  He looks up at TIM, who is still far up - - near the
  top, in fact, he has to come to a complete stop.


114 INT SHED  DAY

  ELLIE keeps pushing the buttons. She's getting closer to the
  button for the fence.


115 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  TIM, terrified, has frozen where he is.

        GRANT
    Tim - - you have to let go!


116 SHED  DAY

  ELLIE's still punching the buttons, now only a half a dozen away
  from the one for the fence, now five, now three - -


117 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  GRANT and LEX are botch screaming at TIM

        GRANT
    C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!

        LEX
    Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!

        TIM
    I can't!  I'm scared!

        GRANT
    Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to
    three.

        LEX
    Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!

        TIM
    I'm afraid I am gonna fall!

        GRANT
    Go, go, go, jump!

        TIM
    You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!

        GRANT
    Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim!
    Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!

        LEX
    Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!

        GRANT
    Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to
    three.  I'll catch you.

        LEX
    Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says,
    quick!

        TIM
    Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.

        GRANT
    Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to
    Three..

        LEX
    You're gonna get electrocuted
      (or)
    electrified!  The power's coming back!

        TIM
    Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

        GRANT
    Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch.
    One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two,
    three - -

        LEX
    You're gonna get electrocuted
      (or)
    electrified!

        GRANT
    It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the
    counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do
    all the counting, okay?

        LEX
    Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!

        GRANT
    I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex,
    I've got to get him!


118 INT MAINTENANCE SHED  DAY

  ELLIE finally pushes the button for the fences. It stops
  flashing and lights up, a brilliant white.

119 EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  The fence HUMS as it awakens.  GRANT and LEX are SCREAMING at
  TIM:

          TIM
    Okay, okay!  I'm going to count to three.  One, two,
    three....

  With a low, loud frightening BUZZ - -

  - - the fence comes alive.

  POW!  Tim is cut off mid-sentence, and literally thrown from the
  fence.  He SLAMS into Grant.  They fall to the ground.  Lex runs over
  to them.

          GRANT
    Tim, you're okay?  You're okay?

  GRANT notices a larger problem.

          GRANT (cont'd)
    He's not breathing.  Tim?


120 INT MAINTENANCE SHED

  ELLIE watches as the banks of fluorescent lights in the
  maintenance shed come on, one by one.

  The lights are going on in rows, coming closer and closer to
  her. Finally, her row comes on.  She follows the light and sees - -

  - - a raptor, right there, behind the control panel!  It
  SLASHES, taking a lunging sweep at Ellie, but gets stuck, its feet and
  legs tangled in the maze of pipes on the floor.

  This is our first good look at one of these things, and if it
  weren't so terrifying, we could admit that it truly is a thing of
  beauty.  It's the biggest of the raptors, intensely muscled,
  coordinated as hell, a smoothly designed predator.

  Ellie SHOUTS and falls back into the pipes on the other side of
  the aisle.

  The raptor untangles itself from the pipes and gives chase, just
  as Ellie SLAMS the mesh door closed. The raptor BANGS against the mesh
  door, Ellie falls to the ground.

  She holds on by kicking the door shut as the raptor continues to
  push himself through the door.  Ellie is able to get the door closed.
  She stands, but then falls back onto one of the walls.

  A dead arm falls onto her shoulder.  RAY ARNOLD is there, or
  what's left of him, stuck in the tangle of pipes.  Ellie moves away,
  and his arm falls to the ground.

  She doesn't realize that she has moved right back near the mesh
  wall - - and the raptor comes at her again. Ellie takes off running as
  fast as she can, back the way she came.  She drags the flashlight with
  her, running over the dead arm and Arnold's legs.

  She continues to run, her headset dangling, the flashlight
  dragging behind her on its cord.

  She reaches the stairs and hits them hard, flying up them.  The
  raptor must be right behind her, she can hear the CLICKING and CLANGING
  as it scrambles up the stairs, but she doesn't look back.

  She reaches the top, throws open the door, hurls herself outside
  - -


121 EXT SHED  DAY

  - - and SLAMS the door behind her, just as the raptor's head
  SNARLS at her from near the top of the stairs.  She runs out the fence
  and collapses.

A121  EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  TIM is still unmoving.  GRANT is performing CPR, alternately
  compressing Timmy's chest fifteen times, quickly, and breathing into
  his mouth twice.

  LEX is freaking out.

  Fifteen compressions.  Two deep breaths.

        GRANT
    C'mon, Tim.

  Fifteen compressions.  Two deep breaths.

        GRANT
    TIMMY!

  Fifteen compress- -

  Tim GASPS and comes to.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Good boy, Tim. Good boy.

        TIM
    Three.  (Two, three).


  CUT TO:


B121  EXT JUNGLE  DAY

  ROBERT MULDOON creeps slowly through the jungle foliage,
  tracking his prey.  He ducks and walks through a hollow log, underneath
  a fallen tree, following the RUSTLING sound up ahead of him.

  He can see just a trace of the raptor's gray flesh as it movies
  behind the bushes up ahead, staying camouflaged enough to deny him a
  decent shot.  Thinking he's got a moment, Muldoon extends the back
  handle of the gun and clicks it into place.  He prepares to take aim.

  A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the
  large iris of a flower.

  The flower blinks.

  It's the eye of the raptor.  Muldoon sees it.  He raises his
  gun.

  Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of
  the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, HISSING at him.

  The corners of Muldoon's mouth twitch up into a smile.  He draws
  a bead on the animal.

  His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes,
  both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face.  His
  eyes flick to the side - -

        MULDOON
    Clever girl.

  - - which is where the attack comes from.  With a ROAR, another
  raptor comes  flashing out of nowhere and pounces on him.  The gun
  BLASTS, but wildly, and the raptor's claw SLASHES through Muldoon's
  midsection.

  Muldoon SCREAMS and falls back, the raptor locked on top of him,
  all tooth and claw all of a sudden.

  As the second raptor makes the kill, the first raptor strides
  slowly forward and watches approvingly.

  It throws its head back and SNARLS.


122 INT VISITOR'S CENTER  DAY

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX come into the deserted visitor's center.  A
  large sign that says "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth. . ."  droops
  overhead.  Grant now carries Tim, who is weakened but conscious.

        GRANT
    HELLO?!

  But nobody answers.


123 INT RESTAURANT  DAY

  GRANT, TIM, and LEX come into the restaurant. Grant carefully
  sets Tim in a chair at one of the tables.  Lex across from him.

        GRANT
  I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a
  doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?

        LEX
      (scared as hell)
    Yes.

  Grant nods.  He looks at Tim for a second.

        GRANT
    Your hair's all standing up.

  He gently rearranges Tim's hair, which is wild, all over this
  head.  Tim looks up at him weakly and manages a smile.  Grant smiles
  back.

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

  Tim laughs.  Grant pauses for a second, as if debating something
  - -

        GRANT (cont'd)
    Be back soon, guys.  I promise.

  He leaves.  As he goes across the lobby of the visitor's center
  and outside, they can see his silhouette, moving through a translucent
  mural that depicts dinosaurs in various natural settings.  It's quiet
  for a second as Lex and Tim just look at each other.

  Tim goes across the room, to an all-you-can-eat table on the
  other side, and quickly piles some food on a tray.  He brings its back
  to the table.

  Lex digs in, munching on veggies, grabbing food with two hands.
  Tim enjoys his food, too.

  Lex comes up with a spoonful of lime Jell-O from a plastic
  dinosaur egg cup - - but her hand freezes halfway to her mouth.

  Tim looks up, and sees the expression on her face.  She's
  staring over his shoulder, eyes wide, the Jell-O quivering in her
  shaking hands.

        TIM
    What?

  Tim turns around.  Behind him, one of the silhouettes on the
  mural is a raptor, in a hunting pose.

  While they stare, the silhouette of a real raptor moves out from
  behind it and creeps forward, in the lobby of the visitor's center.


124 INT KITCHEN DAY

  LEX pulls the shiny metal door shut as quietly as she can.  It
  latches with a distinctive CLICK, but there's no lock.

  She runs to a panel of lights switches and kills them all,
  plunging the room into semidarkness.  She helps TIM down an aisle and
  they hide at the end, behind a counter, breathing hard.

  A raptor's head pops into view, visible through the round window
  in the middle of the restaurant door.

  It just looks for a moment, its breath steaming up the window.

  THROUGH THE WINDOW,

  as the steam evaporates, the raptor can see a part of Tim that
  is not entirely hidden by the counter.

  IN THE KITCHEN,

  TIM and LEX remain frozen in fear as the raptor first SNIFFS at
  the bottom of the door, then THUMPS its head against it.

  But the door doesn't budge.


  CUT TO:


125 EXT COMPOUND  DAY

  GRANT walks quickly down the narrow path towards Hammond's
  compound, eyes darting from side to side, not exactly sure where he's
  going.  From far off, he hears someone SHOUTING to him.

  He turns.  He sees ELLIE, standing outside the bunker.  She's
  waving to him, SHOUTING something too faint for him to hear.

  He furrows his brow and walks towards her.  She SHOUTS louder.
  He walks faster.  He's closer now, and he can finally make out where
  she's shouting.

        ELLIE
    Run!

  Grant takes off running towards her, not even looking back. He
  races up, and she runs into his arms.

        ELLIE (cont'd)
    Where are the kids?!


126 INT BUNKER  DAY

  JOHN HAMMOND stands between GRANT and ELLIE in the bunker,
  watching as Grant RACKS the bolts on a ten gauge shotgun.

        GRANT
      (to Ellie)
    It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third
    one's contained?

        ELLIE
    Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.


  CUT TO:


127 INT KITCHEN DAY

  OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO THE KITCHEN,

  the raptor stares down at the door handle, cocking its head
  curiously.  It SNARLS and bumps the door handle with its head, but that
  doesn't do anything.

  It reaches out, toward the handle, with one clawed hand.

  IN THE KITCHEN,

  Tim and Lex stare in shock as the door handle starts to turn.

  The door opens.  The first raptor stands in the doorway, draws
  itself up to its full height, and looks around the kitchen.

  Now, a second raptor joins it in the doorway.  They move into
  the room, brushing against each other.  The first raptor SNAPS as the
  second, as if to say "keep your distance."

  Now the raptors split, taking two different aisles. Tim and Lex
  crawl away, Tim awfully weak now, down a third aisle, around the other
  side of the counter from the raptors, moving in the opposite direction.

  As Tim and Lex pass the raptors, one of the raptor's tails SMACK
  into some pots and pans, knocking them off the counter.  They fall on
  the kids, who manage to keep quiet.

  The kids keep moving as one of the raptors dips down, looking
  through an open cabinet to inspect the racket.

  Tim and Lex reach the end of the aisle and round a corner - -
  but Timmy's falling behind now, and he accidentally brushes against
  some hanging kitchen utensils.

  Both raptors turn.  One jumps onto the counter, knocking more
  kitchen stuff to the floor.  A ladle CLATTERS to a stop, and the
  strange metallic sounds confuse the raptors for a moment.

  But then they move, in Tim's direction, SNIFFING, heading right
  for him.

  The raptor on the floor is just about to turn the corner to
  where Tim sits, exposed and exhausted, but both the raptors suddenly
  stop, hearing a CLICKING sound from the other end of the aisle.

  It's Lex, TAPPING a spoon on the floor to distract them.  The
  raptor on the counter jumps down and starts cautiously towards Lex's
  noise, leaving Tim.

  Lex sees a steel cabinet behind her, its sliding door slid up
  and open.  She crawls inside, silently.

  Tim sees the raptors make the turn towards Lex, SMASHING more
  stuff around with their tails.  He turns and sees a walk-in freezer in
  the far wall, with a pin-locking handle.

  As Lex tries to pull the overhead door to the cabinet shut, one
  of the raptors rounds a corner and sees her reflection on a shiny
  cabinet front.  Lex tries frantically to lower the cabinet door, but
  it's stuck.

  Tim takes a few deep breathes, summons what little strength he
  has left - -

  - - and makes a break for the walk-in freezer.  He's limping,
  dragging himself, really moving like a wounded prey now, and - -

  - - the other raptor spots him.  Both raptors go into a pre-
  attack crouch - -

  - - and they pounce, one towards each of the kids.

  Lex tugs on the cover, to the avail - - Tim's raptor charges
  after him, just open floor space between them - -

  - - and Lex's raptor THUDS into a shiny surface bearing hr
  reflection.  It chased the wrong image.  It sags to the floor,
  semiconscious.

  At the other end of the aisle, the real Lex SCREAMS as the other
  raptor bears down on Tim. Tim reaches the freezer, rips the door open,
  and falls inside.  The floor is cold and slick and his feet go right
  out from under him.  He sprawls across the floor, rolls out of the way
  - -

  - - and the raptor slips and falls into the freezer too, right
  past him.

  Tim drags himself to his  feet and out of the freezer.

  The raptor makes one last lunge, right on Tim's heels, its mouth
  wide open - -

  - - but Lex SLAMS the door shut just as Tim is clear.  The
  raptor's head is caught for a second, but it SNARLS, retreats, and
  Lex's gets the door shut all the way.

  The raptor ROARS and SCREAMS inside. Lex jams the pin through
  the handle, locking it in.

  Now the other raptor staggers to is feet.  Groggy, it SMASHES
  into stuff all over the kitchen. Lex throws her arms around Tim again
  for support and they take off.


128 INT RESTAURANT  DAY

  TIM and LEX hurry across the restaurant.  They stare back over
  their shoulders as they run.  They CRASH into GRANT and ELLIE.

        LEX
    It's in there!

        ELLIE
    Control room.


129 INT SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR DAY

  GRANT, ELLIE, and the KIDS race down the second floor corridor
  towards the control room, Grant helping Tim.


130 INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  The door to the control room SMACKS open.  GRANT, ELLIE, and the
  KIDS burst in. Ellie heads straight for Nedry's computer terminal.
  Grant moves Tim to the side, and races back to the door to lock it.

        LEX
    We can call for help?!

        ELLIE
    We've got to reboot the system first!

  She sits at the computer and studies the screen.  It's flashing
  to her, dominated by a maze-like grid.  She studies it, confused.

        GRANT
      (at the door)
    Oh, no!  The door locks - - Ellie!  Boot up the door
    locks!  Boot up the door locks!

  POW! Something hits the door, hard, from the outside, the kids
  SCREAM, Grant hurls his back against it - - Grant loses his gun.  He
  struggles.  The raptor scratches his head.

        ELLIE
    ALAN!

  - - and Ellie leaps out of the chair and races over to the door
  to help him.  A raptor SNARLS and SNAPS, RAMMING itself against the
  door, trying to force its way into the control room.  It's all Ellie
  and Grant can do to hold the door against the onslaught, but it bucks
  against them viciously.

        GRANT
      (to Ellie)
    Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!

        ELLIE
    You can't hold it by yourself!

        GRANT
    Ellie, get the gun!
      (or)
    Try to reach the gun!

        ELLIE
    I can't get it!
      (or)
    I can't get it unless I move!

  OVER AT THE COMPUTER,

  Lex slides quickly into the command chair at Nedry's terminal.
  She stares at the screen for a moment - -

        LEX
    This is a Unix system.  I know this.  It's the files for
    the whole park.  It's like a phone book - -it tells you
    everything.

  - - and then her fingers start to fly over the keyboard.  Tim
  watches, amazed, as the computer starts to respond to Lex's commands.

        LEX (cont'd)
    I've got to find the right file.  Oh no, this isn't
    right. This might be right, no this isn't it.

        TIM
    C'mon, Lex!  C'mon, Lex!  Go, Lexie!

  Reaching another menu, Lex spots a box on the screen that reads
  "DOOR INTEGRITY."  She reaches out and touches it.  The screen BEEPS -
  -

        LEX
    There it is, I got it! This is it, I did it.  Yes, yes!

  - - and the door latch panel BUZZES.  Grant and Ellie put
  everything they have into it and finally the door SNICKS shut, locking
  the raptor outside.

        GRANT
    What works?

        LEX
    Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for
    it, we got it!


  CUT TO:


131 INT BUNKER  DAY

  A phone RINGS.  HAMMOND and MALCOLM look at each other, wide-
  eyed.  Hammond lunges for it.

        HAMMOND
    Grant?!  The children alright?


132 INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  All the screens in the control room have come alive now, and
  data is scrolling by at incredible speed as every remaining system is
  the park comes back on line.  ELLIE is at the keyboard with LEX now,
  figuring things out, and GRANT is on the phone.

        GRANT
    The children are fine.


133 INT CONTROL ROOM DAY

  HAMMOND is on the phone, MALCOLM is trying to listen.

        HAMMOND
    Thank God.

        GRANT (o.s.)
    Listen, the phones are back up!  Call the mainland!
    Tell them to send the damn helicopters - -

  Suddenly Grant stops in the middle of his sentence.  A SCREAM
  cuts in, then three GUNSHOTS, fast, and a horrible CLUNKING as the
  phone is dropped.

        HAMMOND
    Grant!  GRANT!

  But there's no answer.


134 INT CONTROL ROOM  DAY

  Grant's rifle lies on the floor, smoking, several spent shells
  alongside it.  The front window of the control room has three huge
  impact shatter patterns in the glass, where the gunshots hit.

  TIM goes into an open panel through the ceiling, and into the
  crawl space.  LEX climbs the ladder, followed by ELLIE and GRANT.

  Grant looks over to the front window, scared as hell, just as -
  -

  - - it SHATTERS in a shower of glass and a raptor EXPLODES into
  the control room.  It lands on its feet on a work station console,
  images from wall projectors falling across its head.

  Grant vaults himself up into the ceiling, and knocks the ladder
  with his feet.

  The raptor tilts its head curiously, looking up at the swaying
  ceiling.


135 IN THE CRAWL SPACE,

  Grant, Ellie, and the kids dash across the ceiling panels,
  moving fast, but carefully, so as not to break through.

  SMASH!  The raptor's head bursts through a panel behind them,
  leaping up at them, SNARLING and SNAPPING.

  It drops down again, and they keep moving forward.  But now it
  ERUPTS through a panel right in front of them.  They SCREAM, its teeth
  CLICK just inches in from of Ellie - -

  - - but the raptor can't hold itself up there, and it falls back
  to the floor of the control room.

  Grant looks around frantically and spots an air duct a few yards
  away.

        GRANT
    Follow me!

  They move for it, but the raptor's head CRASHES through the
  ceiling again, this time right underneath Lex.

  She SCREAMS and is lifted up, on top of its head, and pinned to
  the ceiling above.

  Grant SMASHES hit boot into the side of the raptor's head.  The
  raptor SLAMS at him, latching onto his boot for a second before the
  raptor's own weight pulls it back down.

  Lex goes down with the raptor, spinning into the hole in the
  ceiling, tumbling down.  Grant grabs her by the collar at the last
  second, but Lex dangles there, above the raptor.

  The animal flips over onto its feet and crouches to pounce just
  as Grant summons his strength and jerks Lex back into the ceiling.

  The raptor springs, but too late.  Grant and Lex scramble over
  to the air duct and join Ellie and Tim inside it.


136 IN THE AIR DUCT,

  Grant, Ellie, and the kids crawl through the air duct as fast at
  they can, the thin metal BOOMING and creasing around them.  They reach
  a metal gate that shows daylight beneath.  Grant reaches out and pulls
  it up.

  Through the gate, they can see the lobby of the visitor's center
  below.  They're directly above the skeletons of the dinosaurs, the T-
  rex and the sauropod it's attacking.  The unfinished skeletons are
  surrounded by scaffolding.


137 INT ROTUNDA DAY

  Grant and the others climb down out of the air duct and onto a
  platform of the scaffolding that stands alongside the skeletons.  They
  continue down to the second platform, then the third.  They suddenly
  see - -

  A RAPTOR, standing to the side by the second floor railing.

  It's much too far to jump to the lobby floor, so Grant climbs
  gingerly onto the nearest skeleton, the towering brachiosaur.

  They climb down as fast as they can.  Grant helps Tim down, Lex
  and Ellie follow.  Ellie goes to the tail.  Lex moves to the front.
  Grant lands on the main body in the middle with Tim.  And the raptor
  watches them.

  Up in the ceiling, the skeleton's anchor bolts GROAN in the
  plaster, starting to pull free.  But for now, they hold.

  The raptor flies out and lands on the back of the middle section
  of the skeleton.  SNAP!  It CRACKS apart with the weight, sending the
  sections spinning in all different directions.

  Grant and Tim twirl on the middle section. Tim begins to slide
  down.  Grant tries to hold on to him - - but Tim loses his grip and
  falls to the ground right underneath the swinging, large middle section
  of the dinosaur skeleton.

  Meanwhile, Lex spins on the front section.  She slips - - and
  tries to keep from falling as she hangs by her legs.

  The anchor bolts in the ceiling RIP free, ZINGING past them like
  bullets.  The entire brachiosaur skeleton collapses like a house of
  cards sending Ellie to the ground.  She covers herself with her arms,
  trying to protect her head from the shower of falling bones.

  Lex falls, landing on the ground with bones falling on top of
  her.  She SCREAMS.

  Grant, alone in the middle section, looks up and sees the cable
  about to SNAP - - he falls!  The large section of the skeleton comes
  careening down, heading straight for Tim, who lays where he fell on the
  ground.  It comes SMASHING down. . . with just enough space for him to
  be safe.

  The raptor tumbles to the floor in a cascade of splintering
  bone.

  It lands on its back a few yards away and staggers for a moment,
  the wind knocked out of it.

  Grant lands in front of Tim.  He stands, and goes to Tim.  Lex
  sits up and sees the raptor regain its feet.  She SCREAMS.

  Ellie stands.  She notices the shadows of the second raptor,
  standing behind the visqueen.  She stops dead in her tracks.  She backs
  up towards Grant and Tim.

  The raptor comes out from under the plastic and looks around.
  Grant gets Tim out from under the skeleton. Lex joins them.  They back
  away from the raptor, approaching from the left side.  They back up
  towards the large rock in the middle of the room holding the other
  skeleton.

  The raptor crouch in their pre-attack stance - -

  The group is caught in the middle of the two approaching
  raptors.

  Lex looks back and SCREAMS.  Grant and the others continue to
  back up.  They look up and see - -

  - - TYRANNOSAURUS REX!  It's massive head descends down from
  above.  A set of six-foot jaws clamp down on the raptor.  Eighteen-inch
  teeth sink into its side, and the helpless animal HOWLS in agony as
  it's lifted up, up, up off the floor of the lobby.

  Grant and the others look up in stunned amazement.  They step
  back behind the rock for safety and look to the right.  They see
  another raptor approaching.

  The other raptor goes up in the air now, twenty feet off of the
  lobby floor, held fast in the mouth of the Rex.  It stands in the
  entrance to the lobby in front of the massive hole it ripped through
  the Visqueen wall.  It shakes its enormous head once, BREAKING the neck
  of the velociraptor, then drops it, dead, to the floor at its feet.

  Grant, Ellie, and the kids skirt the battle royal on the lobby
  floor and dash of the door of the Visitor's Center.

  The second raptor turns from the humans and lunges at the Rex's
  side, leaping twelve feet into the air and rending the Rex's flesh as
  it comes down, slashing it open with its six-inch claw.

  The rex BELLOWS in pain, and turns on the raptor, eyes raging,
  and strikes, just once, quickly, as fast as the head of a serpent.  It
  catches the raptor by thick back end, buts one of its enormous feet
  down on it, and tears.

  It rips the last velociraptor in half.

  The rex whirls around - as it turns, its heavy tail
  counterbalances, SNAPPING the other way, sweeping across the lobby and
  SMASHING right through the T-rex skeleton.

  The skeleton collapses in an explosion of bones, falling to
  pieces around the living rex.

  The rex stands majestically in the middle of the lobby, both
  skeletons swept away, SNAPPING like matchsticks as they settle around
  the animal.

  The rex draws itself up to its full height - -

  - - and ROARS.

  The sound is deafening, and the vibrations rattle the entire
  Visitor's Center.  The sign which dangled over the lobby by its one
  remaining wire finally falls, CLATTERING to the floor at the Rex's
  feet, face up.

  "WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH", it says.


137A  OUTSIDE THE VISITOR'S CENTER

  Hammond SQUEALS the Jeep to a halt in front of the steps.
  Malcolm is lying in the back.

  Grant and the other practically fall into the Jeep.

        GRANT
    Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.

        HAMMOND
    After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.

  Hammond hits the gas and the Jeep takes off.

139 EXT HELICOPTER LANDING PAD  DAY

  The helicopter rotors whirl to life as the chopper waits on the
  landing cross.  Two Jeeps ROAR up next to it, one driven by GRANT, the
  other by HAMMOND.


INT HELICOPTER  DAY

  One by one, they climb aboard, their faces white from their
  ordeal.

  ELLIE comes on first, holding LEX.  Then HAMMOND, carrying TIM.
  And GRANT, helping MALCOLM.

  No one speaks.  Hammond takes another look at his dream, Grant
  comes over and takes him back to the helicopter.

  The helicopter takes off immediately.  As they rise into the
  air, they stare out the windows, looking down on the park as it spreads
  out below.


140 DOWN IN THE PARK,

  the helicopter soars over a vast plain.  The Tyrannosaur, which
  is still feeding on the remains of the dinosaurs it ran down and
  killed, looks up.

  It throws its head back and ROARS, waving its little forelimbs
  at the strange thing in frustration.  As the helicopter moves off, the
  T-rex just stares, silently, with huge, yellowing eyes.  It's a moment
  of utter bewilderment for the rex, and we almost feel - -

  - - sad for her.


141 BACK IN THE HELICOPTER,

  Hammond looks down at the park, his eyes full.  He looks over at
  the kids.

  They're in the back of the helicopter, with Grant.  As they look
  out the window, Grant almost absently has his arms around both kids.

  Now Ellie looks at him.  Both he and the kids seem so natural,
  so obviously comfortable and trusting with each other.  She smiles.

  The four of them sit that way, in the back of the helicopter,
  huddled together.  Survivors.

  Grant looks out the window.

  The helicopter sweeps low over a huge flock of sea birds that's
  feeding on a school of fish. As the chopper ROARS near, it kicks up the
  flock.  Hundreds of birds sail off in all directions, powerful and
  graceful.

  Grant looks at the bids and breaks into a wide grin.

  The birds reform as flock again and fly straight into the sun.

  FADE OUT.
