1 OVER BLACK
  1

  Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

  Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.
  It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted
  curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside
  of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing under-
  sea world at night.  HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds:
  landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that
  certain undersea species share with each other.

              CUT TO

2 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
  2

  Caught in its blinding flash, the light moves on, fingering
  the fog.  A lone buoy dongs somewhere out at sea.

3 EXT. AMITY MAINSTREET - NIGHT
  3

  The quaint little resort town is quiet in the middle of the
  night.  A ground fog rounds a corner and begins spreading
  toward us.  It fills over sidewalks and streets like some
  Biblical plague.

4 EXT. THE SOUTH SHORE OF LONG ISLAND - NIGHT
  4

  It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June.  We see
  a long straight stretch of white beach.  Behind the low dunes
  are the dark shapes of large expensive houses.  The fog that
  has reached Amity proper is seen only as a low-hanging cloud
  that is pushing in from the sea.  HEAR a number of voices sing-
  ing.  It sounds like an Eastern University's Alma Mater.

5 ANOTHER ANGLE - BEACH
  5

  A bonfire is blazing.  Gathered around it are about a dozen
  young men and women who are merrily trading fight songs from
  their respective universities.  Two young people break away
  from the circle, Chrissie almost pulling a drunk and disorderly
  Tom Cassidy behind her.

6 CLOSEUP - CASSIDY
  6

  makes a clumsy try at kissing Christina but she laughs and
  ducks away.

7 ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH
  7

  The fire, now one hundred yards in the b.g., silhouettes
  Chrissie running up a steep dune.  Once there, she pauses to
  look at the ocean that we can only hear.  Cassidy plods up
  the dune behind her, grossly out of shape.

  Chrissie runs down a few steps, leaving Tom Cassidy reeling
  on the summit.  Chrissie's dress, bra and panties fly toward
  Tom, who can't make a fist to catch them.  The dress drapes
  over one half of his head.  Soggily aroused, Cassidy struggles
  to get his shoe off.

  But Chrissie is already in full flight toward the shore.  In
  she goes, a delicate splash, surfacing in a cold ocean that is
  unusually placid.  Chrissie pulls with her arms, drawing
  herself into deeper water.

  That's when we see it.  A gentle bulge in the water, a ripple
  that passes her a dozen feet away.  A wave of pressure lifts
  her up and eases her down again.  Her face shows the beginning
  of fear.  Maybe it's Tom.  She smiles and looks around for him,
  then her eyes go to the beach where Tom -- too drunk to stand
  -- one pantleg off, is struggling with his other shoe.  Chrissie
  turns and starts for shore.

8 CLOSE - CHRISSIE

  Her expression freezes.  The water-lump is racing for her.
  It bolts her upright, out of the water to her hips, then slams
  her hard, whipping her in an upward arc of eight feet before
  she is jerked down to her open mouth.  Another jolt to her
  floating hair.  One hand claws the air, fingers trying to
  breathe, then it, too, is sucked below in a final and terrible
  jerking motion.  HOLD on the churning froth of a baby whirl-
  pool until we are sure it is over.

9 ANGLE - CASSIDY
  9

  in his undershorts, laughing, turning in slow stoned circles,
  a prisoner in his orange windbreaker that seems to have him
  in a full Nelson.  He stumbles to his knees.

  ALARM CLOCK-RADIO

  giving weather bulletin:  marina weather, westerly winds,
  light chop, etc.

  A pair of bumps under the bedsheets.  There is a rustling
  and two stockinged feet swing up and settle heavily on the
  floor.  Follow them as the pad along from hardwood floor
  to bathroom tile.  A light pops on and the feet arrive at a
  scale, board it.

11  INSERT - SCALE DIAL
  11

  In a blur it goes to 191.  Then, as if by magic, the numbers
  float backward to 160.

12  ANGLE
  12

  Martin Brody at forty-two, stands rigid, lifting himself
  from the sink counter-top with both hands.  Satisfied, he
  turns toward the mirror, squinting in the light, measuring
  himself up and down.  Advancing waistline, receding hairline.
  Gray around the ears.  Martin Brody makes another silent
  promise to get his act together -- tomorrow.

  He reaches for the sliding mirror and opens the medicine
  cabinet.  There is a travel brochure of Arizona attached
  to the shelf.  Brody shakes his head and removes it.  He
  closes the mirror which now reflects his wife, Ellen Brody,
  pert and poised off to one side.

           ELLEN
       Martin.  Aren't you tired of Maine
       lobster, Long Island duckling and
       Ispwitch clams.  Just once couldn't
       go for a Big Mac at the bottom of
       the Grand Canyon this summer?

           BRODY
       Look at me, I'm not even awake.

           ELLEN
       You've had no time off in two years,
       Martin.

           BRODY
       Living here is time off.

  Brody opens the shower door to turn on the water.  Ellen
  has scotch-taped a travel folder for exotic Mazatlan, Mexico
  on the shower head.

13  INTERIOR - BRODY BEDROOM - MORNING
  13

  Martin is getting dressed after his shower.  Ellen stands
  by the curtained window.

           BRODY
       Larry Vaughn says we'll pull a record
       season.  Ellen, we're collecting high
       enough rentals to cover the mortgage
       payments for all three of our beach-
       front investments.

           ELLEN
       I know where we can invest in an Indian
       Chief Motor-home for the whole of August,
       drop it off in Aspen, Colorado and jet
       back to Boston by Labor Day.

  Ellen pulls from behind her back three brochures of trailer
  home rentals.

           BRODY
       Uh...look, Ellie.  Let's just ---

           ELLEN
         (completes the
         sentence)
       -- play it by ear.

  Ellen turns to open the curtains.  Sunlight and ocean
  sparkle pour in.  A glorious view.

           ELLEN
         (false happiness)
       Another shitty day in Paradise.

  The sunlight catches Brody's Police Chief badge as he slips
  on his shirt, and we discover why he can't go anywhere.

14  INTERIOR - BRODY'S KITCHEN - MORNING
  14

  Brody, ripping open a twenty-five pound bag of Kennel Ration
  as five hungry mutts somersault around his feet.  The tele-
  phone rings, and Brody one-hands it as he attempts to sow
  all five doggy bowls with missed double-helpings.

           BRODY
       Mornin' Hendricks.  What's what?

  He listens, sours, and takes a breath.

           BRODY
       First goddamn weekend of the summer...
       great start!
         (beat)
       No...take him back to the beach.
       Maybe she washed in.

15  EXTERIOR - ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING
  15

  Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past,
  taking the view to an enormous billboard depicting a
  typical summer day in Amity.  A beautiful model splashes
  in the golden surf, languishing in a Solarcaine sun.
  AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written above her flailing arms.

16  EXTERIOR - AMITY BEACH - DAY
  16

  Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach.
  The surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn
  about from the receding tide.

17  CLOSER ANGLE
  17

  Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred
  yards down wind.  Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police
  attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him
  in last night, poke around the smoking ashes of the bon-
  fire.  Brody fingers the missing girl's shoes, purse and
  clothes.  In the daylight, Cassidy looks like a junior in
  High School and misconducts himself, wavering between
  inflated maturity and tear-blown adolescence.

           BRODY
       Christine what?

           CASSIDY
       Worthingsly...Worthington -- no one
       ever died on me before.

           BRODY
       You picked her up on the ferry.

           CASSIDY
       I didn't know her.

           BRODY
       And nobody else saw her in the water?

           CASSIDY
       Somebody could've -- because I was
       sort of passed out.

           BRODY
       Sounds to me like maybe she ran out
       on you.

           CASSIDY
       Oh, no, sir.  I've never had a
       woman do that.  I'm sure she drowned.

  A shrill whistle makes them turn.  Hendricks is fifty
  yards away, on his knees.  He blows again, a feeble report
  this time.

           BRODY
       We may know in a minute.

  Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows
  with:

           CASSIDY
         (pathetically)
       You can't make me look -- !

18  MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE
  18

  A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.
  The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

  Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a
  sheet.  Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune,
  and ventures up.  Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying
  something at the same time.  Brody nods understanding and
  steps up cautiously.  And looks down.

  Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.
  Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry
  horseshoe crabs in an escape frenzy and they boil over the
  top of the dune and down its slopes.

  Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves
  him over.  He shakes his head.  An awkward moment.  Then
  Cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his
  eyes looking everywhere but down.  Brody says something else
  and Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea.  Brody
  puts his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.
  Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

  The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected.  He falls
  backward in a sitting position as though shot.  Nods yes --
  it's her.  Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling
  close.  Hear his BREATHING.  He looks around, envisioning
  the week ahead of him....

19  INTERIOR - BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY
  19

  Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding
  a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer.  Polly, his sixty-one year
  old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand
  pad of messages and reminders.

  In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs,
  sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

  Brody sits behind the typewriter, only to find that somebody
  has placed a travel folder to sunny Scottsdale, Arizona
  between the rolls of his Smith-Corona.  He sighs and replaces
  the colorful brochure with the grim accident report.  As he
  types, Polly reads his calendar to him, undaunted by Brody's
  heavy malaise.

           POLLY
       This is in no order of importance,
       Chief:  There's a meeting on the
       Amity Town Council on Aging this
       Monday night, Bentoncourt Hall.
       The Fire Inspector wants you to go
       over the fireworks site with him
       before he catches the one o'clock
       ferry.  Mainly, you have a batch
       of calls about that new Karate
       school.

20  CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

  Brody has just typed the girl's name.  He skips the space for
  Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin in-
  formation he has collected from her wallet.

           POLLY
       Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy
       Ale, Tisberry's Hardware...they
       say it's those nine-year-olds
       from the school practicing karate
       on all those nice picket fences.

  The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

           POLLY
       It's the Coroner.  Somebody pass
       away in the night?

  Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening,
  as he turns to the typewriter.

           BRODY
       Jesus, Santos.

21  INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT
  21

  Cause-of-Death line rolls into place.  The hammers punch
  out:  SHARK ATTACK.

22  BRODY
  22

  leans forward, staring at what he just wrote.  Polly cocks
  her head and removes the phone from his ear.

           POLLY
       What's the matter?

  Brody takes a breath.  A new resolve comes over him.

           BRODY
       Polly, I want to know what water
       recreation the Island fathers have
       on for today.

           POLLY
       Right this minute?

  Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

23  BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE
  23

  Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

           BRODY
         (To Hendricks)
       Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'
       signs?

           HENDRICKS
       We never had any.  What's the problem?

  A local merchant comes through the door.

           LOCAL MERCHANT
       Glad I caught you.  There's a city
       truck with New Hampshire plates
       parked right in front of my....

  Brody pushes past him and out the door.

24  EXTERIOR - AMITY MAIN STREET - DAY
  24

  In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth
  of July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activ-
  ity, purpose and haste in each stride.  As he turns a corner
  a little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.
  This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner.  Santos
  looks both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

  Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward
  course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the
  sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence.
  Keisel intercepts Brody on the run.

           KEISEL
       Eight to ten years old.  Average
       size about five-four, otherwise
       the overhand chops would be higher
       up on the fences.  And I have a
       pretty damn good idea who two of
       the little bastards are.

           BRODY
         (out-walking him)
       Call me later in the afternoon,
       Harry.


25  ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

  Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties
  editor of the Amity Gazette.  Together they cut a beeline for
  the other side of the street.

25-A  ANGLE - AMITY STREET
  25-A

  Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction
  and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Lynwood's Hardware and
  Sporting Goods...so overstocked that beach umbrellas, alumi-
  num deck chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus
  of color from the display window to the sidewalk.

26  INTERIOR - LYNWOOD'S HARDWARE & SPORTING GOODS - DAY

  The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list
  with a mainland delivery man.

           LYNWOOD
       Stuff's no good to me in August
       when the Pilgrims come in June...
         (to Brody)
       Go on and help yourself to what-
       ever you need, Chief.  Can you
       work the register?

27  EXTERIOR - LYNWOOD'S - DAY
  27

  Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails,
  paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island.  He
  starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the
  street in the patrol jeep.  He stops fast enough to call
  attention, leans out the window.

           HENDRICKS
         (he has fully
         read the report)
       I sent Sammy out ahead of me to the
       South Chop beach until I can make
       up the signs.

           BRODY
       Let Polly do the printing.

           HENDRICKS
       There's a Scout troop in Avril Bay
       doing the mile swim for their
       Merit Badges.  I couldn't call
       them in, there's no phones out
       there.

           BRODY
       Oh, brother!  Gimme the keys, Lenny.

  Brody leaps behind the wheel as Hendricks steps out.

28  EXTERIOR - VAUGHN'S REALTY - DAY
  28

  A secretary is removing four 8 x 10 glossies of beachfront
  houses from the display window, revealing Larry Vaughn, the
  Mayor of Amity, exchanging anxieties with Ben Meadows and
  Coroner Santos and two other city Selectmen.  They come out
  in a group, reach the sunlight, and squint down the street
  as Brody careens around the corner and out of sight.  Deputy
  Hendricks, laden with his arts and crafts, passes them on
  the street front.

           VAUGHN
       What have you got there, Lenny?

           HENDRICKS
       We had a shark attack at South
       Chop this morning, Mayor.  Fatal.
       Gotta batten down the beach.

  Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the
  impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

           VAUGHN
       Who've you told this to, Lenny?

           HENDRICKS
       I just found out about it -- but
       there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in
       the water a coupla miles down the
       coast from where we found the girl.
       Avril Bay, thereabouts.  Chief
       went to dry them off.

           VAUGHN
         (to Meadows)
       Take my car, okay?
         (to Hendricks)
       You come with us, Lenny.

           HENDRICKS
       I've got all these signs here....

           VAUGHN
       C'mon, it'll give us time to think
       about what they're going to say.

  They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty
  signs on the doors.

29  EXTERIOR - AVRIL BAY - DAY
  29

  A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a lifebuoy
  that marks the quarter-mile.  A rowboat with Scoutmaster and
  bullhorn keeps pace.

30  ON THE BEACH
  30

  Two older Seascouts time the event with stop watches, and a
  couple of dozen parents look on, shading their eyes.  Brody's
  jeep pulls up in the background and stops.  He gets out and
  starts down to the breakwater when the Mayor's Cadillac pulls
  up and skids to a stop.

  Brody pauses momentarily as Mayor Vaughn emerges, trying to
  affect an easygoing appearance.  Reaching Brody, he slips an
  arm around his shoulder, trying to slow him as Brody leads
  the gang toward the breakwater and the slogging Scouts.

           VAUGHN
       Where are you going to get the
       authority to close the beaches?

  Brody stops.  He sees pitiful Hendricks standing by the car
  with the signboard material.  Brody begins to slow burn.

           BRODY
       Are you asking me as the Mayor, or
       as a Real Estate broker, or our of
       friendly interest, or what, Larry?

           VAUGHN
       I just want you aware of what you're
       doing before you tinker with the life
       blood of all those sage and discriminating
       souls who elected you.  Next week's the
       goddam Fourth of July!  We've got a couple
       thousand summer people coming over here
       who will gladly use the Cape Cod beaches
       if they can't use ours.

           BRODY
       So what you're suggesting is we lay out
       a smorgasbord for the shark.  All you can
       eat for the price of a weekend on Amity
       Island.

           VAUGHN
       We're not even sure it was a shark.

           BRODY
       What else could do that?!

           VAUGHN
         (to Coroner Santos)
       Boat propeller?

           SANTOS
       Possibly.  Yes....

           VAUGHN
       Swims way out...night...fishing boat
       comes along ---

           BRODY
         (looking at
         both of them)
       What is this?

           MEADOWS
       We've never had shark trouble here,
       Martin.  They don't come in close.  No
       reefs, or fish-processing plants, slaughter
       houses.  Nothing to keep it interested.

           BRODY
       You print whatever you want.

           VAUGHN
       Martin, sharks are like ax-murderers.
       People react to them with their guts.

  Brody looks toward the open water.  The Boy Scouts have made
  a turn and are passing the lifebuoy marking the three-quarter
  mile point.

           MEADOWS
       Whatever was out there is miles out
       to sea by now.  Sharks don't have
       swim bladders like most fish -- they
       have to keep moving or drown.  Don't
       you know anything about them?

           BRODY
       I...don't go around the water much.

           VAUGHN
       It's one chance in a million this'll
       happen again.
         (points)
       Look at that...safe and sound.

  The Boy Scouts are emerging exhausted; some flop down on their
  backs, happy it is over.  Brody considers this.

           VAUGHN
       Had you yelled 'shark,' those Cub
       Scouts would have broken the free-
       style record for the hundred-meter,
       then busted our backs with word of
       mouth.

           BRODY
       If that's the test case for your
       million-to-one shot, I'm glad I lost.

  Vaughn feels secure that Brody will not act in haste.  He puts
  a hand on his shoulder, turns and walks him toward the cars.

           VAUGHN
       Listen, Chief -- the funniest thing --
       you know the white picket fence
       around my realty office....

31  CLOSE QUINT
  31

  Rising like Neptune from out of the deep, Quint walks the
  sidewalk in the pool of his own shadow.  He is a sleek and
  sinewy specimen, inches over six feet, and with a face making
  it hard to determine where the scars leave off and the wrinkles
  begin, though he is no older than fifty.

  Quint seems to be heading for the local tavern when a crunch
  of seafaring fishermen pour out, forming an impenetrable knot
  around the sidewalk in front of him.  One of them sees Quint,
  who approaches with no intention of slowing down.  The seven
  fishermen never give it a second thought, they part like the
  Red Sea, clearing a beeline trail to the bar doors.  Quint
  bursts through their obliging ranks and turns into the Music
  store.  The tiny bell jingles daintily.  Two of the Portu-
  guese fishermen spit three times, taking no chances.

32  INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY
  32

  Quint brushes against the counter.  The shopkeeper is helping
  a ten year old boy fix a new reed to his clarinet.  The little
  boy produces a mellow low tone, then wonderingly rides the
  scale.  With little or no effort, Quint's gnarled hand floats
  up and drops like a sledge on the service bell.  The shop-
  keeper's eyes pop up, the kid hits a bad note and squeaks.

           QUINT
         (forced politeness)
       Four spools number twelve piano wire.

           SHOPKEEPER
       Catch any monsters lately, Mr. Quint?

  Quint's eyes never leave the little boy.  He is drilling him
  with a sidelong whammy.  The boy feels Quint nailing him and
  a ragged assortment of squeaks, blurps and missed notes over-
  ride the sounds of the shopkeeper unspooling the piano wire.

33  INTERIOR BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

  A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white.  The
  dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white

  his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books,
  all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks.  The door
  opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's mood.

           ELLEN
       Can you stand something to eat?

           BRODY
       Love a cup of tea.  With lemon.

  Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window
  which overlooks the south bay.  It is the hour of dusk.

           ELLEN
       Mikey loves his birthday present.

           BRODY
       Where is he?

           ELLEN
         (with a slight laugh)
       He's sitting in it.

  Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

           ELLEN
       Honey.  He has it tied up to the
       jetty with a double-knot.

35  BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

  Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school
  chums are in the water, swimming around it.  Brody opens the
  window and calls down:

           BRODY
       Son! -- Out of the water now!

           MICHAEL
       My boat's neat, Dad!

           BRODY
         (turning to Ellen)
       Tell him I want him out of the ocean.

           ELLEN
       It's three feet deep, Martin.  You
       said that shark was half way back
       to Florida.

           BRODY
         (angry now)
       Michael!  Come inside the house!

           ELLEN
       It's his birthday tomorrow.

           BRODY
       I told him not to go out until he
       memorized the handbook, safety reg-
       ulations and ---

  Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book.  One large text is
  open to a page of illustrations.  Among them is the famous
  painting, The Gulf Stream, which depicts a black fisherman
  in a small dinghy much like Michael's, being assaulted by the
  pressing jaws of three man-eaters.  Startled, Ellen closes the
  book, opens the window and sticks her head out.

           ELLEN
       You heard your father! Out now!

36  EXT. BEACH - DAY
  36

  A jelly-bowl woman visitor to Amity's beaches plunges head-
  long into the white foam.  There's enough of her stuffed
  into a one-piece bathing suit to sate the appetite of any
  shark for weeks.  Remarkably buoyant, she chops at the water
  revealing other cheerful Sunday bathers trying to enjoy the
  last uncluttered weekend before the holiday crowds.

37  ANGLE - MARTIN BRODY AND ELLEN

  Brody is balefully alert this morning, sitting straight-
  back in his beach chair, coating the swimming area with
  careful looks.  About ten other adults and a dozen children
  attend this casual birthday get-together.

           MAX
       I don't envy you this summer, Chief.
       Every year the swarms get worse.

           MAX'S WIFE
       I know now why there's not a sane
       Parisian left in Paris from July to
       September.

  Brody hears a SCREAM from the water.  He cranes his neck past
  Max's wife in order to see.

38  BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
  38

  A young lady is being pulled underwater to her hair.  Instantly,
  she is jerked up again -- sitting on her boyfriend's shoulders,
  laughing hysterically.

           BRODY
       What?

           MAX
       What?

           BRODY
       Did you say something?

           MAX
       No -- yeah, I was wondering if it's
       true.  That you sit in your car
       the whole while over on the
       mainland ferry.

  His son Michael along with sever other boys rush headlong
  into the gentle surf with their inflatable rubber rafts.
  Another youngster, Alex Kintner gathers up his Day-Glow yellow
  raft, but his mother takes issue and a tug-of-war ensues.

  Overlapping dialogue:

       MAX'S WIFE        ALEX

  The fat woman is going out too far.

           ALEX' VOICE

       Fine!  Cold.
         (to Ellen who
         walks over and
         sits next to Brody)
       How'd you do it -- getting him to
       the beach?

           ELLEN
       It's Michael's birthday.

           DENHERDER
       Hope we get this weather next
       weekend!

42  BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

  The fat woman is not where he last remembered seeing her.  He
  sort of rises to one knee, his eyes combing the surf.

           ELLEN
         (kissing him on
         the cheek)
       Do you want me to call the boys in?
       Honey, if this worries you ---

           MAX
         (bolting down
         his drink)
       Does this -- mortal fear of the
       water have a clinical name, Martin?

       Drowning.

43  EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

  A fish-eye view of people lying on rafts.  From below we see
  the outlines of swimmers, arms and legs dangling tantalizingly
  in the blue water.  Traveling this way from raft to raft,
  there comes a space of open water followed by a quick view of
  a single raft.  A pair of feet kicking and arms paddling produces
  bizarre underwater vibrations, louder than human ears would
  normally perceive.

  They begin a water fight, slapping at the ocean with karate-
  type blows, sending little explosions of water at each other.
  Then, no more than ten feet beyond the fighting, a genuine
  water eruption upstages the child's play.  Everybody turns
  just as the ocean flattens itself out again.  A pug-faced
  over-sized twelve year old named "P.J." renews the fighting
  with a genuine Karate yell.

  He stands all the way up this time.  Parents begin calling --
  a frantic inventory for lost children up and down the beach.
  Brody is on the move, barreling to the shoreline.  He kicks
  up sand passing Alex' mother, who looks up from her novel
  annoyed.

           BRODY

  Appears from the shoot of a breaking wave.  He is all right

  the sandy beach is tinged with pink.

  A crowd of men and women in an angry tangle outside of Brody's
  office.  These are the shop owners, real estate brokers,
  hotel managers and Selectmen of the Island.
  Through the windows, the Southbeach High School Band is
  practicing for the Fourth of July Parade.
  Brody and Vaughn exit Brody's office and enter the fray.

           VAUGHN
       I'm glad everyone could make this
       meeting.  Why don't we wander
       down the hall to my office where
       there's room.

  All follow Brody and Vaughn.  Meadows pushes through the
  crunch to speak.

           MEADOWS
       Don't keep us in suspense Mayor.
       What's the verdict?

  Vaughn cannot bring himself to say it right away.

           BRODY
       Larry and I have agreed to close
       all beaches for a limited period
       of time to give us a chance to
       contact the Port Authority and
       United States Coast Guard out on
       Montaux.

           MRS. TAFT
       Well, that could take all summer!

           VAUGHN
       Twenty-four hours.

           BRODY
         (turns angry)
       We never agreed to that.

           MR. WISEMAN
       I do a thrifty business her but
       I'll not see it flourish at the
       price of any more lives.

           MRS. TAFT
       Three reservations cancelled and
       I still have August rentals open.

           VAUGHN
       So do I, Martha, so do I.

  They reach Vaughn's office.  It is being painted.  Newspapers
  are strewn all over the floor and paint-splattered tarps over
  the furniture.  Vaughn's secretary still dutifully takes calls.

           SECRETARY
       Larry, two Newsday reporters and
       one from the New York Times, cal-
       ling every 15 minutes.

           MR. POSNER
       Good people, nobody saw a shark.

           MEADOWS
       What they'll print is maybe it was
       a shark.

           MR. POSNER
       Oh wonderful, and what we'll have
       is maybe a summer.

           MR. POLK
       Town'll lose tax revenue, municipal
       services'll deteriorate, the
       people'll begin to move away.  Oh,
       I don't care.  I never raised my
       kids to be somebody's lunch.

           VAUGHN
       We have no way of keeping the lid
       on what happened yesterday.  There
       were well over a hundred bathers
       on the beach, three-quarters of
       them from the mainland.

  Vaughn leads the way down the hall toward the Bureau of Records
  room.

           MR. GARDNER
       I'm not interested in participating
       in any cover-up Mayor.

           VAUGHN
       I wouldn't worry too much about
       that, Max.  The President himself
       couldn't stop the mushrooming at
       this point.

  Selectman Denherder almost whispers in Vaughn's ear.

           DENHERDER
       But couldn't we just say the kid
       drowned?

           VAUGHN
         (whispering back)
       We couldn't even find the little
       bastard.

  Vaughn opens the door to the Bureau of Records.  About two
  dozen children sit around, twisting multi-colored Kleenex
  into artificial flowers for the big parade.  Vaughn turns
  his face into a condescending grin.

           VAUGHN
       Could the big people have a grownup
       meeting in here, please, children.

           CHILD SPOKESMAN
       Get lost.

  A voice from behind Vaughn draws him away.  It is a small
  but muscular black man named Salvatore.

           SALVATORE'S VOICE
       Mr. Vaughn?

  He steps out of the shadows, hat in hand.

           SALVATORE
       Mister Quint sent me down from
       Jacobstown.

           VAUGHN
       What for?

           SALVATORE
       Well...he out catchin' them things
       every day practily.  Price's right,
       he come catch yours here.

           VAUGHN
       What's he get?

           SALVATORE
       Ten thousand and a color TV.

           VAUGHN
         (outraged)
       How much?

           SALVATORE
       Twenty-seven inch.  Japanese one.

  Vaughn studies the little blinking man, ready to laugh.

           VAUGHN
       Mister Quint's services are not
       required, thanks.
         (stopping a secretary)
       Is there an empty office anywhere
       in this goddam building?

           SECRETARY
       Weights and Measures nobody ever
       uses.

  Vaughn starts away and the crowd follows.

           DENHERDER
       I'd haul it in myself before I'd
       pay anything to that maniac...you
       wanna hear what he did to three
       friends of mine on a Saint Valentine's
       Day sporting charter?

  They are halted in their tracks by the grim appearance of
  Mrs. Kintner and her benign father.  She is dressed in church
  white with a black arm band.  Mrs. Kintner never says a word.
  She has just tacked something to the community bulletin board
  and is walking through the parting crowd.  With sympathy, all
  watch her leave, then press up to the cork board.  Brody
  fights his way through everyone until we are standing over
  his shoulder, staring at a homemade poster that offers:

       "ALL OR A FRACTION OF $3000 BOUNTY
       TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND
       SLAUGHTER THE SHARK THAT SAVAGED
       ALEX M. KINTNER, JR. ON SUNDAY,
       JUNE 29 IN THE TOWN OF AMITY."

           BRODY
         (to Vaughn)
       Listen, Larry, I'm going to talk
       to her.  This isn't a contest we
       want everybody from Boston to
       Quebec entering.

           MRS. TAFT
       I agree.  If she's going to adver-
       tise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-
       city papers.  There's enough of
       us here in Amity could take care
       of this.

           BRODY
       Larry, I'm responsible for the
       public safety around here....

           VAUGHN
       So I think tomorrow you should go
       out with whoever, and see that
       they don't get hurt.

           BRODY
       But nobody sport-fishes for shark!

  No one will listen.  Already plans are being discussed, sides
  chosen, boats, tackle and tactics recommended.  The din
  overrules Brody, who we pull close to and ---

56  INT. QUINT'S CHUM SHED - DAY
  56

  A naked 100-watt bulb illuminates the electric grinder purring
  in one corner.  The slick black carcass of a pilot whale
  dominates the lighted area.

  Quint is hacking slabs off the whale with his Marine machete
  as his mate, Salvatore rolls an empty barrel to the grinder.

           SALVATORE
         (suspicious)
       Where you find this whale anyway?

           QUINT
       Way out.  Dead as a doornail.

           SALVATORE
       How come harpoon holes in him?

  Quint doesn't reply as he hacks away.  The mate rolls away
  a full barrel.

           SALVATORE
       You hardly never use this chummin'
       for shark.

           QUINT
       For some kinds.

  Quint muscles a new slab into the grinder, slowing it to a
  low growl as it purees the blubber.

           QUINT
       Go hose the deck, we're chartered
       for nine a.m.

           SALVATORE
         (awed, looking
         at chum)
       Think it's one of those they got
       down there?

  Quint's grim smile is reply enough.  Salvatore, looking worried,
  indicates some barrels full of whale pulp.

           SALVATORE
       Load these on or what?

  Quint is hacking revenge from the mutilated carcass.  He spits
  away the dripping perspiration.

           QUINT
       'Not required'...you heard the
       man.
         (answering Salvatore's

  Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody.  Silhouettes
  of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

  In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters
  from a quaint summer cottage.  They pause to watch the
  declining moments of the day.

  Three Selectmen also stand watching.  One of them seems to be
  whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby
  dune.

  Sounds:  Surf and hammering.

              CUT TO

60  EXTERIOR - GRASSY INLET AND PIER - NIGHT
  60

  Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional
  angler, push a wheelbarrow ahead of them as they near the
  tumble-down jetty that leads fifty feet out into the black
  water.  Both men scuff along, exhausted.

           DENHERDER
       You wanna call it a night after
       here?

           CHARLIE
       It's only two-thirty.  What, are
       you tired?

           DENHERDER
       Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind
       three nibbles back.

  Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the wheel-
  barrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog chain
  and a large patched inner tube.  Charlie takes out a monster
  hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the rickety
  pier that is only about five feet across.

           DENHERDER
         (reaching into the bag)
       Leg of lamb this time?

           CHARLIE
       Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

           DENHERDER
         (a hyena laugh)
       We're blowin' half the bounty on
       bait ---

  The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the
  end and start to work.  Charlie baits the hook with a massive
  chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of
  chain to a skinny piling.  Charlie then fastens the inner tube
  to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

           DENHERDER
       One more after this, then I'm going
       home.

           CHARLIE
       Set?

  Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it
  is.  Charlie heaves the bait.  Splash!  The inner tube follows
  and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain
  playing out from the wheelbarrow.

           CHARLIE
       Tide's taking it right out.

  Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling.  He
  turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a
  fractured board.  Denherder paces, bored to death.

           DENHERDER
       You do this all the time, right,
       Charlie?

           CHARLIE
       Twenty years.

           DENHERDER
       I can't believe that people pay
       money to go fishing.  This is really
       dumb.  This isn't even relaxing...
       it's just boring.

61  CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

  Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men straighten.
  Denherder is goggle-eyed.

           DENHERDER
       Hey!  What's this?

  The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the
  wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty.  A section of chain
  tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into
  the air.  Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing
  out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

           CHARLIE
       Look at him take it!

           DENHERDER
       Do I set the goddam hook?

           CHARLIE
       Let him do it!  Go-go-go-go-go!

  It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow pilings.

  resounding CRACK.

  The end of the jetty is yanked loose.  Denherder is flipped
  like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, where
  he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

64  DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW
  64

  The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards,
  is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top of
  it, his lit pipe still going.

           DENHERDER
       CHARLIE!  JUMP!

  Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the
  flotilla of wood draw away.

65  CLOSE - CHARLIE

  looking seaward.

66  CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW
  66

  The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back
  in his direction.

           CHARLIE
       Holy Jesus Christ!

  Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out of
  the water.

           DENHERDER
       Get the hell out!  Charlie!  Swim!

  Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore.  The jetty
  is getting closer.  Suddenly the chain dragging it through the
  water is severed, and the charging wood falls behind -- an
  enormous black fin breaks water like a periscope, making course
  corrections as it comes for Charlie.

  Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his balance
  on his way to help Charlie.  Charlie has reached the last pylon
  toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold.  But ---

67  INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

  The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.
  That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky
  and -- CHARLIE SCREAMS.  An explosion of water and bubbles
  mercifully blot out the image.

  Ben Gardner, ruddy faced and ornery, is a fisherman as sea-
  worthy as they come.  With his make, Swede, he starts to
  board the Flicka, a Bertram 28 Sports Fisherman.  Absently,
  he makes preparations for casting off, his attention focused
  on surrounding dockside activity and ---

69  HIGH ANGLE - HARBOR
  69

  Chaos.  A dozen cars and trucks double-parked on the dock with
  out-of-state plates from New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut.
  Other vehicles are pulling up and parking.  Men unloading their
  weapons.  Boarding small boats.

  A queue of up-islanders, down-islanders, out-of-towners at the
  boat rental shack.  From rank amateurs in their green golf
  slacks to the alley-poor in levi tatters -- all of this dis-
  dainfully observed by Ben Gardner.

  Cries of "Cast Off," the starting of diesel engines in con-
  trast to the flooded baby Evenrudes -- all of this helped
  along by a lot of honcho swearing.

70  CLOSE - HARBORMASTER

  Sleepy, the old salt bends over the dock, washing out his
  coffee pot in the oily harbor water.  He sets down the pot,
  pulls a small wooden chair into position, on which teeters a
  bowl of Kellogg's Rice Krispies, and collapses into it with
  spoon in hand.  He watches stoically as:

71  CLOSE - BRODY
  71

  Riding up on his police bicycle, Brody joins Deputy Hendricks
  who is trying to break up an argument at the Rental stand.

           HENDRICKS
       Christ, Martin, that Kintner lady
       must have taken out an ad in Field
       & Stream.

           BRODY
       Looks more like the Harvard Lampoon.

           OUT-OF-TOWNER
       I didn't come all the way out here
       from New Rochelle to be gouged in
       the seat of the pants by this loan
       shark.

           BOAT RENTAL MAN
       Prices always go up around here
       after June One -- isn't that right,
       Chief?  If you want leaky boats at
       lower rates, go up to the Hamptons.

72  ANGLE FROM ONE OF THE BOUNTY BOATS
  72

  The narrow channel leading out of port lies ahead.  An incoming
  boat, a Formula 22 Inboard/Outboard with 110 h.p. Volvo engines.
  A few of the smaller craft begin zig-zagging to clear the right-
  of-way, their wakes causing annoying chop in the bay.

73  ANGLE - INCOMING FORMULA 22
  73

  Matt Hooper, a bearded, backpacking young man, is at the helm,
  peering ahead at the ragtag armada.  He ties up, revealing for
  the first time a seven-by-four foot steel cage in the stern,
  drawing some attention.

74  BACK TO DOCKSIDE
  74

  Another man and his two buddies heft a trash can into one
  of the boats.  He lifts the lid, and the stench throws his
  head into near whiplash.

           WALTER
       What is this sewage?

           BARWOOD
       For chum.  Let's move it.

           WALTER
       What's chum?

           BARWOOD
       Anything that attracts 'em.

  Brody looks over the dockrail at the boarding.  Eight men
  have piled into a tiny Glasstron and are now loading various
  and sundry weapons, from crossbows to spear guns.  Brody
  walks over to the harbormaster.

           BRODY
       Isn't there a limit to how many
       men those boats'll carry?

           HARBORMASTER
       Sit down next to me, son, and we'll
       find out.

75  CLOSE - GARDNER
  75

  exchanging distasteful looks with his mate.  He is casting
  off the bow lines just as Felix and Pratt, two down-island
  characters run over.

           FELIX
         (more a declaration)
       Okay, we go out with you.

  Gardner quickly pushes off, leaving Felix with his boarding
  leg in the air.

           GARDNER
       Hunt with the pack, sport.  I'll
       fish for it my way.

  Felix and Pratt make obscene gestures and run off, looking
  for boats not yet filled to capacity, trying to make a deal.

76  ANGLE - LANDING
  76

  Hooper sees Brody, up in arms about something, walking toward
  him.  Hooper starts to speak, but Brody veers aside and yells
  over the pier at the loading boats.

           BRODY
       No dynamite!  Hand that stuff over
       or you'll never leave port!

           MAN IN BOAT
       It's fireworks.  I read somewhere
       it attracts 'em.

           HOOPER
       Sharks are equipped with two long
       cords of nerve tissue that function
       as a sort of radar for homing in on
       underwater vibrations.
         (to Brody)
       Understand you're having a little
       shark trouble.

  Brody turns and walks away, Hooper barely keeping up with him.

           HOOPER
       I know you have a visitor off your
       southern shores.  I think it could
       be my shark.

           BRODY
       It belongs to whoever catches it.
         (to a late arrival)
       You'll move this car to a parking
       slot, mister, or it won't be here
       when you get back.

           HOOPER
       Sir, I'm not with these others ---

           BRODY
       It's always nice to meet an educated
       man.

           HOOPER
       I'm interning at the American
       Museum of Natural History, but the
       Oceanographic Research Institute in
       South Africa is co-sponsoring my
       thesis paper arm in arm with the
       Natural Institute of Health and the
       Marine Fishery Service.

  Brody pauses to look hard at Hooper. A careless amateur trips and
falls
  into the harbor beyond him.

           BRODY
       I don't have time to help you with
       your homework.

  Brody goes over to lend a hand.  Hooper persists.

           HOOPER
       I'm trying to prove that the shark
       that killed Christine Watkins last
       Friday was the same rogue that
       savaged these.

  Hooper pushes a mimeographed sheet in front of Brody.  About
  twenty names and addresses in all.

           BRODY
       One shark did all this?

           HOOPER
         (his excitement
         multiplying as
         he goes on)
       The trail of a rogue shark leads
       all over the world.  This is only
       a theory.  It has never been authen-
       ticated, but there is a wonderful
       chance that the shark that killed
       the Watkins girl and the man-eater
       I tagged off the Great Barrier Reef
       are the one and the same.  Off and on
       I've tracked it to New Zealand,
       Santiago Bay, Cape Town South Africa
       ...uh...the Gulf of Guinea, then
       West Palm Beach, Florida last
       December -- and finally predicted
       it would follow the warming Gulf
       Stream into the Northern Seasonal
       Zones, and release an attack pattern
       along the Jersey Coast.  I was off
       by just three hundred miles.  It
       hit you instead.

           BRODY
       You'll pardon me i f I don't help
       you get your Ph.D. while my town here
       degenerates into some high-class
       ghost resort.

  Brody starts away.  In the background all boats are heading
  toward open ocean.

           HOOPER
       All I'm asking is for a little future
       cooperation.  I could predict future
       outbursts of attack activity in the
       area.  Use me...Let me use you.  I
       scored 93 on my Orals, for crying
       out loud!

           BRODY
       We've had two other attacks since
       the Watkins thing, both fatal.
       Could you kill it for us?

           HOOPER
         (honest response)
       No sir, I couldn't.

           BRODY
       Then how do we begin to cooperate?

           HOOPER
       By letting me see Christine Watkins.

77  EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY
  77

  The armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fif-
  teen boats in all.  One man heaves cherry bombs into the water.
  A smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us
  Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while his
  friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

  A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading instructions
  aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, Vol. I."
  A boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net over-
  board, full of gaps and split ends.  The professionals look
  professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 make it
  impossible for everybody.  Collisions are barely averted.

78  THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR
  78
thru
  thru
84  The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and
  84
  death struggle, his rod in a tight arc.  His buddy leaps across
  to lend a hand.

  Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.
  This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fisher-
  men.  Shouts of I'M ON!  DIG IN!  STRIKE!  Then a tangle of
  tackle springs from the water.  They have hooked each other.

  Joy turns to swearing.   Arnold Felix stands up to applaud the
  mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his
  Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it were
  a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes ---

  Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over
  backward ---

  The Scallop boat swerves right, and bows into an eleven-foot
  Glasstron ---

  A Proud Mariner standing in the stern with his 30.06 is
  knocked off balance and pitches forward into the drink, his
  gun exploding outward and ---

  The wad of shot from the exploding rifle hits the rigging of
  a passing boat sending the jib, mains'l and about twenty
  pounds of rigging on top of the bewildered occupants.

85  ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT
  85

  Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast
  arc.  A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin
  crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty tail
  threshing.  One man is screaming success, the other two slapping
  the angler on the back.

86  CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX
  86

  They spot it and sour.

           PRATT
       Well, get over there! He ain't
       caught it yet!

  The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes
  a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt.  He tests it,
  firing once in the air.  As they near the scene of the struggle,
  eleven other boats begin converging, until ---

87  HARRY'S BOAT
  87

  Everyone wants to get into the act.  They are attacking the
  threshing beast with all they've got.  Pratt uses his auto-
  matic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun.  There are
  occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck from
  time to time as bullets skip by.  Finally, the shark stops
  threshing.

88  FELIX AND PRATT
  88

  Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

           PRATT
         (exultant)
       Hand me that pole!  Quick!

  One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and
  leans out to grab the moribund shark.  But Harry won't give
  up the line, still reeling in.

           HARRY
       Beat it!  I hooked him!

           PRATT
       How's the family, Harry?
         (to the man with gaff)
       Go on and do it!

           MAN WITH GAFF
       We split down the middle?

  Pratt nods reluctantly.  The man swings, lodges the gaff and
  hauls the shark up onto the gunwale.  A paroxysm of cheers
  from the surrounding boats.  Smoke flares are fired into
  the air.

           HARRY
         (a tug-of-war)
       Let go my shark!

  It is a ten-foot blue, and what a mess -- splattered with
  bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices.  But
  it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to cap-
  size the boat.  Pratt panics and fires six times with his .45.
  The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and split
  the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water rises.  Every-
  body stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

89  HIGH ANGLE FROM SHORE

  On a hummock overlooking the cluster of boats stands Quint.
  He is laughing out loud -- a sharp, piercing bark that has
  little real humor in it.  Below, the circle of boats tighten
  around the spreading stain of crimson.

  Hooper is measuring the bite marks on the Day-Glow raft with
  his dial calibrators.

       mind.

  Hooper scribbles notes, then mumbles something inaudible
  into his pocket cassette recorder.  Coroner Santos looks
  to Brody, plaintively.

           CORONER SANTOS
       That was a different sort of acci-
       dent.  As I told you ---

           BRODY
         (guilty, angry)
       Let him.

  The coroner hesitates, then walks to the ice chest and slides
  open the drawer.

92  CLOSE - HOOPER
  92

  At first his face registers shock.  Then, with forced composure,
  Hooper steadies his hands and begins to take pictures with his
  Minolta.

           HOOPER
       I've heard the boat-propeller story
       several times.  And the nocturnal
       hatchet-murder story, the dashed-
       upon-the-razor-coral story --
         (to Brody)
       The little boy was never found?

  Brody nods, looking down at his feet.

           HOOPER
       They're very successful creatures,
       sharks.  Eighty million year's
       antiquity for the species of the
       Great White.  The family goes as far
       back as three-hundred million.  Plenty
       of time to get good at what they do.

  An attendant flies into the room, joyfully out of wind.

           ATTENDANT
       They called from the dock, Mr. Brody!
       They got it!

96  A PROCESSION OF TWENTY MEN
  96

  dragging the shark by a tail-rope from harbor to beach.
  A dog follows, barking at the remains of the blue.  As they
  arrive at the beach Meadows takes charge.  Talks to both his
  photographer and the bounty hunters.

           MEADOWS
         (to photographer)
       I want a good one for under the
       headline -- nearer the water.  Get
       a group shot with the shark.  Use
       it on page one, six inches by six
       columns, center.

  Some of the men have run ahead, happily knocking down some
  of Brody's NO SWIMMING signs.

           MEADOWS
         (seeing this)
       Great!  Bring one over here.

  In the background; voices, laughter.  Some joke about the
  "big-time fisherman" -- "Ben Gardner, not even back yet!"
  Others open beer, throw frosty cans around, making it look
  like a Miller's commercial.

  Meadows positions the shark and vigilantes.

           MEADOWS
       Group around Charlie Tuna...that's
       right.  No, leave it clear in back
       -- closer with the sign.

  Brody and Hooper are seen approaching fifty yards up the
  beach.

           MEADOWS
       Smile, boys!  On three, drop the
       sign.
         (to photographer)
       On three, Bill.  One...two...three.

  Click.  Cheers.

           MEADOWS
       One more.  Just the two prize-winners.

  Mock groans as the posse moves aside.  Pratt and the gaffer
  remain.  One of the others raises the sign again for take
  two.

           HARRY
       I hooked him y'know?

           MEADOWS
       In a little tighter please.

  The gaffer doesn't fancy sidling up to the critter.

           GAFFER
       Better check this bastard.

  He starts to poke it in the eye.  Pratt on the other side
  leans forward for a closer look, gaff in hand.  The gaffer
  pokes the eye.  The Blue shark is wide awake, a vicious
  lunge in the opposite direction that snaps the gaff in
  Pratt's hand completely in half.

           VOICE IN CROWD
       Christ!  Ain't it dead?

  Pratt squeezes out a little smile and shuffles eight feet
  to his right out of range.  Hooper and Brody walk into the
  frozen tableau.  Hooper walks over to the shark, eyeing it
  with both amusement and disappointment.

           BRODY
       Yours?

           HOOPER
       No, this one's a blue.

           HARRY
         (insisting)
       I hooked him.

           BRODY
         (persisting)
       Is it the one?

  Hooper unravels a lab thermometer on a long nylon cord,
  twirling it over his head like a lariat, finally hurling
  it out into the ocean.  He then unhooks a steel tape measure
  from his bag of tricks and spools out feet and inches from
  the shark's nose to tail.

           HOOPER
       It's sure big enough -- ten point
       six feet.

           PRATT
       Who is this guy?

  Hooper is reeling in his thermometer.

           BRODY
         (doesn't want to say
         a 'student')
       The Institute of Sharks sent him
       to lend a hand -- Matt Hooper.

           PRATT
       That's right, except he's half a
       day late now that I already caught
       it.

97  HOOPER
  97

  reading the thermometer.

           HOOPER
       I'm not so sure.  Blue sharks pretty
       much operate on the warm-water law,
       and limit their attacks to seventy
       degrees and up.
         (holding out thermometer)
       Ocean's fifty-five.

           PRATT
         (after a stymied beat)
       Who is this guy?

           HOOPER
       The Great White's body temperature
       in the lateral musculature is almost
       eighteen degrees above whatever the
       temperature of the water.  I don't
       know if this is our bite culprit.

           PRATT
         (beginning to rave)
       If you'd have seen the fight he put
       up, you'd shut up.  Hell, he ate a
       nine-year-old boy yesterday morning,
       the bastard, and goddammit...
         (kicks the shark
         in the nose)
       ...this is my shark!

  Hooper removes from its sheath the meanest fourteen-inch
  hunting knife Pratt has ever seen.

           HOOPER
       Only one way to know for sure...
         (handing Pratt the
         knife, handle first)
       ...and since it's not my shark, I'm
       not slitting open the belly to see
       what portions of the boy is still
       inside.  Am I...?

  Groans are heard from the bounty hunters, some of whom start
  to turn away.

98  CLOSE - BRODY

  Uncomfortable and queasy at the thought of it.

99  CLOSE - PRATT

  He wraps his hands behind him in defiance of the proffered
  blade.

           PRATT
         (whiny)
       Well, shit -- this guy caught it
       with me.  And Harry over there
       hooked it!

  as he poises the knife himself toward the underbelly and ---

       BRODY         HOOPER
  Not here, Mr. Hooper ---  This could be it.  He's big
          enough all right, but I still
          can't be sure until ---

           BRODY
         (nods toward
         upper beach)
       -- the boy's mother.

102 POINT OF VIEW
  102

  Mayor Vaughn, Mrs. Kintner and her father approaching.
  Mrs. Kintner is draped in black mourning, and never utters
  a sound.  She lifts her veil, walks two paces forward and
  spits down at the shark, takes two paces back and replaces
  the veil, recovering her poise.

           VAUGHN
         (to Brody)
       This it?

           HOOPER
         (interrupting)
       I won't know until I perform a
       full autopsy.

           VAUGHN
         (sotto to Brody)
       Who is this kid?

           BRODY
       He's a fish expert from the Oceano-
       graphic Foundation.

           VAUGHN
         (looking him up and
         down; in a wholly
         irreverent tone)
       Well, it doesn't take much of an
       expert to see that this is the big-
       gest, ugliest, meanest-looking shark
       ever hooked around Amity Island.
         (to the gathering
         of men)
       Who caught her?

  Harry steps forward, pointing.

           HARRY
       This guy, Pratt, and me.

           VAUGHN
       A thousand dollars apiece is not a
       bad day's haul.

  Vaughn begins shaking hands with the three winners, and
  Meadows snaps some bonus pictures.  Mrs. Kintner's father
  draws close to Brody and Vaughn, handing Vaughn a card
  from his pocket.

           FATHER
       At whatever the cost, my daughter
       has requested that all preparations
       be made to ship this animal to her
       home town of Marblehead, Mass.  Can
       you accommodate us?

           VAUGHN
       What the devil for?

  Nary a blink from the old man, and Vaughn looks to Hooper,
  weighing the alternatives.

           VAUGHN
       We'll see it through, Mr. Sands.
         (to Martin)
       Martin, you start collecting those
       signs.  And keep your friend away
       from that demon with his pigsticker
       there.  Let's show some respect for
       the loss we've incurred.
         (to Meadows; walking
         him up the beach)
       Get the story on the state wire.
       Try to get AP and UPI to pick it
       up in New York or Boston to put it
       on the national.  Call Dave Axelrod
       in New York and tell him this is
       from me, and he owes me one.

           BRODY
       Some field you picked.

           HOOPER
       Well, there's dolphins -- but they
       talk too much.

              CUT TO

105 INT. RADIO ROOM - COAST GUARD STATION #4 - EVENING
  105

  One man is at the radio, another, a laundry-white officer,
  walks toward Brody.

           OFFICER
       Can't seem to raise your Mr. Gardner.
       Maybe his radio is out.  Or he could
       have put in somewhere else.

           BRODY
       He would have called his wife.

  They walk out together, into an eerie dusk fog.

           BRODY
       No point sending up a plane, huh?

           OFFICER
       I'll get a patrol boat on it.  If
       you'd like to go ---

           BRODY
         (laughing under
         his breath)
       I don't do so hot on boats.

           OFFICER
         (going)
       We'll contact you down there if ---

           BRODY
         (urgently
         stopping him)
       Listen ---

           OFFICER
         (they've been
         over this)
       Brody, sharks are always around.
       Blues, browns, makos, thousands ---

           BRODY
       Can't you get rid of just one for
       us?

           OFFICER
       Where is it?  How do we find it?
       It shouldn't come around again.
       Odds are worse on the highways.

           BRODY
       But you could protect the beach -- !
       I mean, you have access to ---

           OFFICER
         (stopping him)
       We could put up a show.  We could
       give you spotters, but in where
       the waves break, the water's
       cloudy and it's hard to spot.
       Or we could string out shark
       repellent -- sometimes it's effec-
       tive.  But then, sometimes ---

           BRODY
       What do I do then?  Pray for
       lousy weather?

           OFFICER
       We're just the Coast Guard, Brody.

  Brody walks into the fog until he disappears.

106 SLOW ANGLE - LIGHTHOUSE
  106

  Brody walking away from the station and lighthouse preoccupied
  with a dozen alternative thoughts.  A shattering blast from
  the fog horn catches him unprepared and he nearly comes out
  of his skin.  Hands clasped to ears, he passes a sign that
  can barely be seen through the fog:  WARNING!  FOG HORN CAN
  BE DAMAGING TO YOUR HEARING!

107 EXTERIOR - FRONT PORCH OF BRODY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
  107

  Hooper is having after-dinner with Ellen and Martin
  Brody, while a spectacular heat-lightning display colors the
  night clouds and dances on the water miles out.

           HOOPER
       There're good things to be said
       about meshing.  It's worked in
       Australia for years.  Repellent's
       a myth.  Now there's a cable avail-
       able charged with 7,000 amps that
       could be strung along the entire
       bathing area.

           ELLEN
       We have Kahlua, Mr. Hooper.

           HOOPER
       Matt.  And I don't drink alcohol,
       but thank you.
         (back to Brody)
       We think the Great Whites possess
       an electrical sense ---

  Michael walks in.  He doesn't smile after the Sunday
  incident.  He is quite dry this evening, and is in possession
  of a ghastly watercolor of a shark tearing a man in two.

           MICHAEL
         (shy, his eyes
         on Hooper)
       Mrs. Pfister had us all draw
       sharks in school today.

           BRODY
       I told you not to wear that cracker-
       jack ring.  It's too big -- you're
       gonna catch it on something and
       lose a finger.

           HOOPER
         (always interested)
       This is a very good rendering,
       Mike.  Looks like a thresher.
       Where'd you learn to draw him?

           MICHAEL
       I -- cheated, and found pictures
       in one of Dad's books.

           HOOPER
         (delighted)
       Get bitten by the subject...or
       just morbid curiosity?

           BRODY
       More in the spirit of the public
       interest.

           MICHAEL
       Mrs. Pfister says if we have a bad
       season, we could sell our pictures
       to the tourists.  We get to paint
       through American History again
       tomorrow.

  Ellen and Brody exchange worried looks.  Hooper digs around
  in his pocket for something, then looks through his satchel
  purse.

           ELLEN
       You want me to speak to her tomorrow?

  Hooper hands Michael a shark's tooth on a wire necklace.

           HOOPER
       I picked this up in Macao.  There's
       supposed to be a superstition about
       these things -- that if you keep it
       with you, you'll be safe from shark
       bite.

  Michael smiles for the first time, and a warm moment passes
  between him and Hooper.

           MICHAEL
       I gotta show this to Guber.

           BRODY
       Don't sleep with that on, son.
       You'll cut something in the night.

           ELLEN
         (squeezing his hand
         across the table)
       That was nice.  Michael hasn't
       smiled since his birthday party
       and that Kintner accident.

           HOOPER
       He was a witness?

           BRODY
         (changing subject,
         referring to storm)
       Yeah.  Listen.  I'm no crack meteor-
       ologist, but I think we're in store
       for some surf.

           HOOPER
       Hope not.  I'm longlining in the
       morning.  You should come along,
       Martin.

           BRODY
       In case you haven't caught the
       island gossip, I never take baths
       -- just showers.

           HOOPER
       Aquaphobia or what?  Mind if I
       smoke?

           BRODY
       No.  Here, wait.

  Brody takes out a lighter as Hooper puts a twisted cigarette
  in his mouth.  Instead of inhaling, Hooper takes a long hit,
  and it doesn't take long for the shock to beat the aroma to
  where Ellen and Martin sit.

           HOOPER
         (behind the hit)
       I'm going to try and snag the old
       boy with 3/32 of an inch stainless
       steel aircraft cable.

           BRODY
         (dubiously amused)
       I could throw your ass in jail for
       that.

           HOOPER
       Brought my own cage, thanks.  If
       this really is my shark, he's got
       a Peterson disc tag on his anal
       fin.  It can't be seen from a boat.

           BRODY
         (growing anger at
         this young man's
         impudence)
       Once hooked, what then?

  Hooper brightens and reaches into his duffel, pulling out
  a shiny stainless steel object about the size of an alarm
  clock.

           HOOPER
       Biotelemetry.  It's a radio collar.
       I bell the cat and then follow him
       anywhere.  I'm trying to make a
       deal with a satellite tracking
       station at Houston, Texas.

           BRODY
         (getting riled)
       Now let's wait a minute.  You have
       him hooked, right?

           HOOPER
         (trying to be jovial)
       Well, I'll never take him without
       a fight, but --

           BRODY
       And you stick that -- cigarette
       case to his neck?

           HOOPER
         (wondering where
         this is leading)
       That's the game plan.

           BRODY
       Then you let it loose.  You let
       it go free.

  Hooper sees where this has arrived.  He swallows the roach
  and takes a breath.

           HOOPER
       I know what you're saying, Martin.

           BRODY
       Your little lab experiment has
       seen three innocent people killed
       over the past three days.

           ELLEN
       Martin, it's not his shark.

           BRODY
       And your list makes me sick.  You
       carry it around with you like
       you're keeping score.

           HOOPER
       Nature has no conscience, Mr. Brody.

           BRODY
       Oh, Christ.  Whose side are you on?
       You told me you'd help us get rid
       of it.

           HOOPER
       What I said was, I'd help predict
       future attacks in your area.  If
       this device works, the early warn-
       ing to other shorefront resorts --
       not just here, but anywhere it
       ranges in the world ---

           BRODY
       I don't give a crap about your
       worldwide conquest.  What about
       right here?  This town is going
       under today!  Where's your humanity?
       You could kill this thing for us,
       flatten its ass and ---

           HOOPER
         (rising)
       I'm staying at the Abilard Arms.

  Hooper gathers his things, climbs into his backpack.
  Smiles at Ellen and kisses her hand.  Ellen smiles, not
  yet recovered from embarrassment.

           HOOPER
       I really liked dinner.

  He leaves.  Ellen looks at her hand.  Brody turns and sees
  her.

           ELLEN
         (it's all she
         can say)
       Nobody kisses hands anymore.

           BRODY
       If you stick that wet spot under
       the black light at the Coney
       Island Aquarium, they'll let you
       in for nothing.

108 EXTERIOR - ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - FOGGY DAY
  108

  The boat is slicing gentle swells into the flat water.
  Hooper is mainlining from a big reel.  Tuna-halibut clips
  attached to each of the lines that bear hooks and floats
  every ten yards.  Large bait chunks are tossed into the
  water.  In the boat with him is Meadows, huddled in a
  corner and trying to appear eager to learn.  Hooper is
  not cooperating.  He storms around, upset and frustrated.

           MEADOWS
       Okay.  What's the second species
       of shark on your dangerous list?

  Hooper opens the throttle half-speed, looking into the sonar
  display that casts a green glow in the soupy weather.  A
  blip appears on the screen that draws a speculative hum from
  Hooper.

           MEADOWS
         (trying to
         sound scientific)
       Fish activity?

           HOOPER
       Very deep -- looks like a school.
         (more to himself)
       Mackerel.  Really clumped together.

  As the two huddle together in the green spill, Hooper touches
  the throttle to increase speed, still slightly puzzled.

           HOOPER
       Staying right with us.

109   INSERT - SONAR ACTIVITY
  109

           MEADOWS (o.s.)
       And didn't you say activity stops?
       If any of those whoppers are
       around?

           HOOPER
       Tends to.  Gets very still down
       there.

110 CLOSE - MEADOWS
  110

  looks up from the scope, and his expression turns to horror.

           MEADOWS
       Look out!

  Hooper looks up in time to avert a near collision with Ben
  Gardner's boat, the Flicka.

  It is completely awash, with water in the cockpit right up
  to the gunwales.  Seat cushions and hatch covers float about,
  banging and thumping.  The boat is wallowing and it seems
  that, given a touch more weight, it will sink.

           MEADOWS
         (shocked)
       That's Ben Gardner's boat!  Ben!
       Ben!

  Hooper comes up alongside, cuts his engine and goes forward
  to tie his bowline to a forward cleat on the Flicka.

111 INSERT - SONAR SCOPE
  111

  Bigger blips, both visually and audibly.

  Taking note of this, Hooper stands a moment trying to figure
  out what could have done this.  There doesn't seem to be any
  damage fore or aft.  Then he notices that one of the after
  cleats on the Flicka has been torn away...there are scars
  on the wood where the screws are used to hold the cleats down.

           MEADOWS
         (skin crawling from
         the foggy stillness)
       He must have hit something...I'm
       sure they had life-belts on board.

  Hooper nods toward the water.

112 ANGLE - WATER
  112

  We see life-belts and jackets floating in the unearthly
  stillness.

113 HOOPER - WIDE
  113

  He gingerly steps onto the rail of Flicka, peeks into the
  cockpit and cabin.  Awash.  No sign of life.  He puts more
  weight down as he cranes his neck further and the whole
  boat lists to one side.  Hooper leaps back to his own.

114 ANOTHER ANGLE - HOOPER'S BOAT
  114

  He opens a locker and pulls out a wet suit and other gear.

           MEADOWS
       Maybe we should just tow it in.

           HOOPER
         (suiting up)
       I'd better see the damage first.

115 INSERT - SONAR SCANNER
  115

  Blip, blop, blip, blip.

116 CLOSE - MEADOWS
  116

  suddenly cold, zips up his windbreaker and turns the collar
  up, as Hooper zips up his wetsuit and clasps on a weighted
  belt.

           HOOPER
       Did he have a dinghy on board?

           MEADOWS
         (just wants
         out of here)
       I don't know.

  Hooper hyper-ventilates as he places on mask, checks his
  "hot" flashlight.

           MEADOWS
         (alone)
       I'd rather we just towed it in,
       Mr. Hooper.

  Hooper finishes hyper-ventilating...smiles to reassure him.

           HOOPER
       Be up in a minute.

  He's ready to go, but hesitates a moment, staring out at the
  sea -- the first time Hooper has appeared to be doubting his
  next move.  He shakes it off, takes a huge breath, lets out
  half and splashes in....

117 ANGLE - MEADOWS
  117

  all alone in the boat.  Just he and the active sonar.  He
  checks the second-hand sweep of his watch, counting out loud.

118 UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER
  118

  Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles.  Warily he turns a
  full circle with his hotlight.  At first we see nothing out
  of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low
  in the water.  But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for
  damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way
  forward.  The hole is about the size of a basketball, and
  the wood around it has been bashed and splintered.  Hooper
  explores the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from
  its sheath and begins to dig at something.  Whatever it is
  comes free in his hand.  As he studies his find, his light
  wanders upward, pointing directly into the dark hole.  Hooper
  looks up....

119 CLOSE - HOLE
  119

  Ben Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the
  Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin
  pinched like a prune.

120 CLOSE - HOOPER
  120

  bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through
  escaping bubbles.  His mask fills with water as he flails
  for the surface.  Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of
  his own boat, scrambles around it, finally coming up between
  the two boats...gulping air, unable to speak yet, shocked
  and scared, out of breath....

           MEADOWS
       Bad -- ?

  All Hooper can do is hold out his hand, open for Meadows to
  see.  A shiny white tooth, at least two inches long, rests
  in the palm of his hand.

           HOOPER
       A White -- it's a Great White, I
       knew it...!  Looks like he died
       of fright in there.

           MEADOWS
         (scared shitless)
       No shark did that to a boat ---

  Hooper rolls up his sleeve, and with one stroke of the tooth
  shaves all the hair off him forearm.

           HOOPER
       One this big could do anything!

  Meadows will never be the same.

121 INT. VAUGHN'S REALTY OFFICE - DAY
  121

  On the run and seeing red, Larry Vaughn speed-walks out of
  his office, grabbing his coat and out the door, cuss-mumbling
  all the way.  Meadows, still in his boat clothing, appears
  behind him, his tie undone and sweating.  Vaughn jumps into
  his car, and just before Meadows can open the passenger door,
  takes off in it.

122 EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - DAY
  122

  Just under the roadside billboard, Hendricks and another
  deputy, Joyner, prepare for a climb with ropes in their
  arms, paint cans and large canvas brushes.

  Beyond them a few feet away, stand Brody and Hooper, watching
  Vaughn pacing back and forth, sucking on a Havana.  He has a
  newspaper in his right hand.  Hooper is sketching on a sketch
  pad.

           VAUGHN
       It says here IT IS CAUGHT!  Period!

  Brody holds out the two-inch tooth.

           BRODY
       Mr. Hooper figured its size from
       this -- it's over a ton.  It's
       also over ---

           VAUGHN
       Put that rotten thing --
         (he pushes it
         away, it slices)
       Yee-ow!

  Hooper steps over to show him his sketch.

           VAUGHN
         (wrapping handker-
         chief around his hand)
       If my hand gets infected....

           HOOPER
       Meet Carcharodon charcharias.

           VAUGHN
       What is it?

           HOOPER
       The shark that just bit you on
       the hand.
         (sketching)
       And this...is you.

  Hooper has sketched the reduced ratio figure of Vaughn with
  cigar standing in front of the jaws.  He looks like a dwarf
  by comparison.

           HOOPER
       Seventeen feet from anterior to
       posterior.

           VAUGHN
       No shark grows seventeen feet,
       for Christ's sake.

           HOOPER
       The famous Swedish naturalist
       Linnaeus believed that the 'great
       fish' that swallowed Jonah was not
       a whale, but a great white shark.

           VAUGHN
       Love to prove that, wouldn't you?
       Get into the National Geographic.

           BRODY
       What should we do about this white?

  Hooper has come prepared.  He takes from his backpack a
  Bomar Brain calculator and ticks away at it while talking.

           HOOPER
       The longer there's nothing to
       munch on here, the better your
       chances he'll go.  That means, of
       course, keeping your beaches
       closed, your fishermen in port.
       The other alternative is non-
       corrosive, 100-gauge steel mesh --
       say, 30,000 feet of it around your
       bathing area.  Concrete blocks and
       installation would run you...oh,
       four, five hundred thousand.  That
       is, unless you could seek a deputa-
       tion from the federal government --
         (notes Vaughn's non-
         believing countenance)
       Beats getting swallowed, doesn't it?

  Vaughn is apoplectic.  His seemingly dead cigar glows again.
  He takes Brody by the arm and leads him out of earshot of
  Hooper.

           BRODY
       Maybe we can make it up in August.

           VAUGHN
       That beach will be open ON the FOURTH
       OF JULY, DAMMIT!

           BRODY
       We have to give this a coupla weeks.

           VAUGHN
       A couple of days.  And that's bad
       enough.  I'll have to think of
       some reason that'll keep the
       grease from frying.  In the mean-
       time, I want that shark killed.
       Either do it yourself, or hire a
       pro, but go door to door with the
       offer.  No more of his bounty
       crap.  And Brody ---

  Vaughn gestures up at the billboard.  The beautiful model
  splashing in the golden surf with flailing arms has been
  significantly reinterpreted.  Some pranksters have painted
  a huge dorsal fin cutting through the waves next to her, and
  she now looks like an hysterical beach-goer stampeding out
  of the water.  The deputies begin covering it over with paint.
  People have been gathering throughout the scene on bicycles
  and a few station wagons.

           VAUGHN
       First the picket fences -- and
       now this.  I want to see those
       little bastards hanging upside
       down by their Buster Brown shoes.

  Vaughn storms away before Brody can reply.

123 EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY
  123

  Hooper is loading some mainline floats and smelly bait fish
  on board.  Two young long-hairs are assisting him.  The old
  harbormaster dips his coffee percolator into the water and
  rinses it thoroughly while watching Hooper load.  He rises
  to his feet and walks across the pier, looking in the oppo-
  site direction about three slips away.


124 ANGLE - A HIDDEN SLIP
  124

  Brody and Deputy Hendricks are supervising another loading
  activity.  Six local fishermen are converting their 16-foot
  fiberglass double outboard into a gunboat.  A sealed crate
  of high concussion palm-sized depth charges gingerly finds
  a place in the bow section, over which fishing gear and
  nets are positioned to disguise the mission.

           BR0DY
         (to Hendricks)
       Don't let him out of your sight.
       Not for a second.  Stay at a dis-
       creet distance -- and dammit,
       Lenny, no shark talk!  The way
       sound carries over water, you're
       a dead giveaway.

           HENDRICKS
       Who's with him?

           BRODY
       Local hire...I don't know.  I want
       to hear from you, Len.

125 EXT. PICKET FENCE ROW - DAY
  125

  Angling down a stretch of picket fence.  Little karate cries
  are accompanied by little flat hands piercing through splin-
  tering wood.

126 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
  126

  The hardware store proprietor, bored and withdrawn, suns
  himself on a chaise lounge surrounded by summer surplus
  that no one is buying, while --

  -- the Amity Gift and Candle shop is offering an outside
  display on a carousel postcard rack of artificial shark-
  tooth necklaces, along with an open-air gallery of shark
  books.  A dozen tourists bunch up as business booms here
  today.

127 INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY
  127

  Ellen is somehow mired behind Brody's desk, two travel
  folders in her absent-minded grasp.  She talks into one
  phone, at the same time she is talking on another to a
  breathy, ticky landlady.  All of this overlapping.  Brody's
  secretary Polly is in the outer office doing three things
  at once.

       ELLEN         LANDLADY
      (into phone)    First it's twenty-four
  I don't know where my husband hours, then it's two days.
  is, Mr. Kretzler.  He's only  It one more guest of mine
  closed the beaches to insure  leaves for Cape Cod, I'll
  your safety....     start a petition!

  From the outer office, we hear:

           POLLY
         (into phone)
       Until further notice!  You'll have
       to ask him about that when he gets
       back.  Good-bye.

  Three people enter.  Two of them, an elderly tourist couple,
  push past Polly and into Brody's office where Ellen stands
  beside the desk.

           MAN TOURIST
       Excuse me -- I see by the papers
       they caught the killer shark.  I
       see by the signs that the beaches
       are still closed, and we were just
       wondering....

           TOURIST WIFE
         (reaches out and
         takes Ellen's hand
         in hers, glowing)
       I think it's a simply wonderful
       positive sign of our times to see
       a woman Chief of Police in a nice
       place like ---

  Ellen removes the receiver from her ear, from which angry
  geese-like sounds filter through.  She starts to explain,
  instead bursts out laughing -- one of those spontaneous,
  funny cries for help that leaves you weak.  She falls
  helplessly into her husband's swivel chair, covering her
  face with Acapulco brochures.

              CUT TO

128 INT. QUINT'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT
  128

  Entering Quint's abode is not unlike a spooky ride at
  Disneyland...the placement of objects, the dungeon lighting,
  the tendrils of smoke and dust in the air makes a visitor
  wish he were carrying a 100-watt bulb.

  There is gear everywhere.  The walls are adorned with jerky
  shark hides, coiled ropes dangle like serpents above a galley
  stove that leaks smoke and holds two weeks worth of filthy
  dishes.  Tubes, barrels, rods, reels, harpoons, an antique
  gun collection and a dizzy array of shark hooks line the
  walls, with one entire wall dedicated to a collection of
  laminated jaws from the blue shark to the Great White.  Con-
  spicuously in the center of the room is a swivel fighting
  chair and it looks like the perfect place to have all your
  teeth pulled.  Into this orifice of decay, Brody enters,
  and from his point of view, we see Quint hunched over a tub
  of steaming Borax.

           BRODY
       I know it's late, Mr. Quint.

  Quint lifts a ghastly set of dripping jaws from the solution.

           QUINT
       Snappy little novelty item.

  Quint demonstrates by holding them up to frame his face through
  the round jagged opening.

           QUINT
       Picture frame...
         (holding it down)
       Toilet seat....

  He looks up at his gallery of jaws.

           QUINT
       No offense, you guys!
         (confidentially
         referring to what's
         left of sixteen
         sharks)
       Very touchy.  All set for the
       Hallelujah chorus and stuck on
       the first note.

  Brody enters the room like he's treading on hot charcoal.

           BRODY
       I would have called you ---

  Quint walks toward Brody with Borax dripping from both hands.
  He places one of them hospitably on Brody's shoulder.

           QUINT
         (without losing
         a beat)
       Sure you would, sweetheart.

  And ushers him into the fighting chair.  He then busies him-
  self around the premises and Brody must use the swivel chair
  to follow him, feeling chills whenever Quint move behind him.

           BRODY
       I'm Chief Brody, Mr. Quint --

           QUINT
       Suits me.  I'm a social undesirable
       myself.

           BRODY
       Listen ---

           QUINT
       Me and your Great big White.

           BRODY
       Who told you?

           QUINT
         (scrubbing teeth
         with a wooden brush)
       What's the count up to down there
       anyway?  You can't have much of
       a town left!

           BRODY
       Got Ben Gardner this time.

           QUINT
         (feigning shock)
       Ben?  Sharks'll eat anything.

           BRODY
       I need to talk to you, Quint ---

  Quint slips past Brody's blindspot to the opposite wall, and
  Brody tenses and swivels too fast, almost spinning 360 degrees
  before braking with his feet.

           QUINT
       Anything!  Know what I found inside
       that tiger?  Aside from fish and
       all?

  He moves proudly to the shelf of jaws and souvenirs
  collected from the bellies of sharks.

           QUINT
       Twenty feet of cable, half an army
       cot, four brass buttons, a cocker
       spaniel, license plate, a drip-
       dry shirt, and a six-pack of diet
       Pepsi....

           BRODY
       We can't have this damn thing
       sneaking in ---

           QUINT
         (as though alarmed,
         he touches a hand to
         Brody's mouth)
       Chief!  Show a little respect.
       Jesus!  Whites are head of the
       mob out there, this sounds like
       Lucky Luciano.

           BRODY
         (wiping his mouth)
       Ever caught one?

           QUINT
       A thirteen-footer and one fifteen --
       teenagers.

           BRODY
       Now you're asking ten thousand
       dollars, but look ---

           QUINT
       Chief, Chief, Chief - forget it.
       I get two bills a day from charters.
       I sell the hides, I sell the teeth,
       I sell the fins to chinks for soup --
       you ought to try a little shark
       sometime!  Hammerhead's terrific -
       here!

  Quint hops to the oven.  An avalanche of pots and pans, a
  burst of smoke, and before you know it, Quint is presenting
  Brody with a hot plate.

           QUINT
       Home-fried hammerhead!

  Brody turns away from the stink.

           QUINT
         (obsequiously
         apologetic)
       Sorry, nothing fancier tonight --
       boy, I do a Mako Provencale -
         (kisses his fingers)

           BRODY
       How's four hundred a day, Quint?

  Quint is suddenly across the room, lowering a bucket in front
  of Brody.

           QUINT
         (fuck off)
       Serve yourself, Chief.  Shark-liver
       oil!  Best lubricant in the world!

           BRODY
         (desperate)
       How much do you want?

  Quint turns, suddenly bitter.  He walks over to a cage with
  a parrot in it.

           QUINT
         (to parrot)
       Clowns trying to bargain....

           BRODY
       I came on my own, Quint.

           QUINT
       Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum.

           BRODY
         (rises, pleading)
       See, if we could make a deal tonight --

           QUINT
       Here's what the price is tonight,
       Chief.

  Quint stalks Brody as he talks.  Brody trying to look reasonable
  as he backs around the room, bumping into objects d'art.

           QUINT
       Twenty-five grand to go for it,
       plus twenty-five more if I land it,
       all repairs on the boat, and on
       me, a new rod from Haydy's in
       London, a life subscription to
       Playboy, a stereo 4-track and the
       color TV.

           BRODY
       Quint, you know they'll never ---

           QUINT
       Let me finish!  If it gets me,
       different deal -- seventy-five,
       no extras!

           BRODY
         (bewildered)
       Seventy-five for who?

           QUINT
         (wildly improvising)
       For nobody!  To make this place a
       museum or something!  'Quint's
       Monster Palace!'  How's that?
       Maybe have me stuffed in the middle
       here --- !

  Quint poses stuffed with a harpoon in the middle of the room.
  This is the first time he has stopped moving.

           BRODY
         (addressing stuffed
         Quint)
       I have to tell them something
       reasonable ---

  Brody looks for the door...completely disoriented, he tries
  to open one of the walls.

           QUINT
       No problem!  Tell 'em that joke
       from World War Two --
         (walks over to
         parrot)
       About the Marines in the landing
       barge?  Sergeant splashes right
       in, yelling 'Hit the beach men,
       follow me and....'

  Quint taps the bottom of the bird cage, and without losing
  a beat, the parrot squawks in falsetto:

           PARROT
       Watch out for the shark!

  Brody has found the door and is gone.  The door swings in a
  breeze.  Quint turns to his gallery of jaws and smiles with
  a mock-courtly bow.

129 EXTERIOR - DOCKS - DUSK
  129

  Hooper's Formula twenty-two tying up in his rental slip.
  He looks dog tired as he steps off and stretches his legs on
  dry land.  The most astonishing thing about Matt this evening
  is his obvious disappointment.

  The gunboat is also tied up, the men unloading.  They are in
  terrific spirits.  Each has caught his limit.  The boat is
  filled with fish, the men filled with stories.  Only Len
  Hendricks shows the strain.

130 ANGLE - BRODY
  130

  riding up on his police bicycle.  He sees Hendricks fifty
  yards away in the dusk, shaking his head.  Brody turns and
  rides down the dock toward Hooper, saying good-bye to his
  day help.

           BRODY
         (tired, apologetic)
       Any luck?

           HOOPER
       Might be for you, Mr. Brody.  I
       think it's all over.

           BRODY
       How can you be sure?

           HOOPER
       The sea is full of fish again for
       one thing.  You won't find sea life
       in the territory of a Great White.
       All the fish we saw in the ocean
       today.  You'd think they were cele-
       brating.  I played low-frequency
       music underwater -- that usually
       works faster than blood.
         (shrugs "nothing")

           BRODY
         (gives him a
         long look)
       Are you feeling okay?

           HOOPER
       There are signals in the water.  I
       can always read them.  And the currents
       are shifting.

           BRODY
       Vaughn's going to want a statement.
       What about taking precautions?

           HOOPER
       I'd take them, sure.  Lookout posts.
       An alarm system.  If you can afford
       picket boats equipped with sonar
       repellent line across the bathing
       area.  Jesus...we must have gone six
       times around this crummy island.

           BRODY
         (still perplexed)
       And you're sure it's ---

           HOOPER
       You'll never be immune to attack.
       It knows where you live now.  Good-
       night.

  Brody is left alone on the dock, the sky darkening behind him.

131 INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY
  131

  Two cavernous iron doors.  Then a crack of vertical light as
  six burly crewmen muscle them apart.  The Amity ferry landing
  is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside
  for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season
  and ---

  Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this
  wholly visual montage of disembarkation.  The next two minutes
  should be treated like a "short film" taking into account all
  of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety of
  Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the
  ninety-day season.

  A.  A train of cars trundle down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

  B.  Young beautiful people from Princeton, Yale, N.Y.U.,
      wearing knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in
      papoose rigs, energized children, senior citizens hold-
      ing hands on the pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

  C.  The sidewalk vendors hawking balloons for the kiddies,
      hotdogs, hot fried clams, Italian ices.

  D.  The Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas, run by students
      on vacation queued up like a bomber wing.

  E.  Hooper is watching.

  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously to
  the windows, Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, their
  wives with blue hair remembering the way from the years before.

  Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend the
  ramp.  They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and matching
  collegiate windbreakers.  They scour the landing, looking for
  someone to save.

  The boat is empty.  Everybody heading inland, anticipating the
  best Fourth of July ever.  Already there is debris on the
  docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

132 INSIDE THE FERRY
  132

  As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their
  combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the
  light and locking in the trade.  The doors latch shut with a
  resounding clang!

              GO TO BLACK

133 EXT. COAST GUARD STATION - DAY
  133

  A young Ensign is demonstrating "Shark-Chaser" to Brody from
  the concrete pier.  He lowers a canister of it into the
  water and a dark cloud begins to diffuse.

           OFFICER
       You'll need about 150 of these --
       twelve feet apart, behind your
       surf-line.  We'd have to string
       them right across, that's say, 2000
       feet....

           BRODY
       Makes sort of a long black
       curtain.

           OFFICER
       Repellent.

           BRODY
         (leveling)
       But it doesn't always work.

           OFFICER
       Well...it inhibits them, Mr. Brody.
         (brightens with facts)
       The astronauts use it.

           BRODY
         (not impressed, gazes
         into water)
       That, and Tang.

134 EXT. AMITY MAINSTREET - DAY
  134

  If you lifted out any hunk of mid-day Manhattan intersection
  and set it here on the colonial corners of Main Street and
  Pilgrimage Way, you couldn't do worse.  This is what Amity
  feeds on between July and September.  This is what the
  tourists pick over between 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M.  This is
  what it's all about.

135 EXT. AMITY MOVIE HOUSE - EVENING
  135

  The marquee lights go on.  Moby Dick is the new substitute
  feature offering.  Pan down to show the theatre manager and
  a boiling, pacing Larry Vaughn.

           VAUGHN
       I want this off before the weekend.
       And if it's not -- !

           MANAGER
       I thought with all this interest...
         (weak smile)
       It's not a documentary, you know.

136 INT. MOVIE HOUSE
  136

137 FULL SCREEN
  137

  Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab in an outpouring of classic
  Melville.  The white whale explodes through the waves and
  crushes sixteen harpooners.  A single sandpapery laugh
  accompanies each special effect.

138 ANGLE - MOVIE HOUSE
  138

  Quint sits in the center aisle, popcorn and ju-ju-bees
  stuffing his face.  The splayed projection beams dance
  around his head as he roars with amusement.  People are
  getting up and moving away from him.  He is watching with
  delight, slapping his thigh, thumping the seat-back with
  his feet.

139 FULL MOVIE SCREEN
  139

  We watch as Ahab gets tangled in the line and dragged under
  by the whale.  Quint can be heard OVER.

140 EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY
  140

  A four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, rider-
  less.  The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color as
  one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not in
  the water.  Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are every-
  where.

141 ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS
  141

  A half-dozen lookout lofts.  As many handsome lifeguards
  with Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loudhailers
  at arm's reach.  Bored, two of the hot dogs train their
  binoculars on some local color.

142 AT SEA
  142

  Tactically flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black
  repellent are four small watch-boats.  A fifth tiny pleasure
  boat darts around the repellent line.  Farther out, cross-
  ing back and forth, are patrol boats six and seven.  To top
  it all off, a Coast Guard blimp floats three hundred feet
  above.

143 ON SHORE
  143

  A crunch of gawkers makes life miserable for a mobile TV
  crew on their van-shaped unit.  A graduate from the Columbia
  School of Broadcasting is interviewing Martin Brody in front
  of dozens of camera-conscious kids.

           INTERVIEWER
         (humorous)
       Will you be going for a dip,
       Chief?

           BRODY
         (ill at ease)
       No, I'll be sticking to business
       today.  As you see, we have spotters
       up and down the beach, and out there's
       the Coast Guard, State Police, County
       Police -- everyone's cooperating
       on this ---

           INTERVIEWER
       The question is, if it's so unlikely
       as you seem to think ---

           BRODY
       It never hurts to play it safe.

           INTERVIEWER
       Thank you, Chief Brody.
         (to crew)
       Let's do a group at the hot dog
       stand.

  Vaughn is watching the ocean, aware that nobody is in yet.
  He turns in the direction of a Selectman and his family,
  and after grunting hellos, falls on his haunches and talks
  through a dogged smile.

        VAUGHN
    Will you please get in that ocean.

        SELECTMAN
    What?

        VAUGHN
    Nobody's going in -- move!
      (indicating his family)
    Them, too!

  He gets up, gesturing "go in" to another townsman.  The
  Selectman gathers his senses, swallows back nagging nerves.

        SELECTMAN
      (to his family,
      false cheer)
    How about a swim, gang, huh?
      (to 12-year-old
      daughter)
    Not you, you have a cold.

  Vaughn spies Hooper, alone on the sand in his trunks, look-
  out at sea.  The Selectman and his family of four start
  into the ocean as Vaughn approaches Hooper.

        VAUGHN
    You've earned a day off, Doc.
    And thank you.

  Hooper just looks at him.

        VAUGHN
    We feel you've done a heck of a job,
    you know.

        HOOPER
      (nods, looks
      back to sea)
    I feel the same about you.

144 ANGLE - SELECTMAN AND HIS FAMILY
  144

  They walk into the surf, deeper and deeper, until a wave
  washes over their heads.  The Selectman surfaces, and realizes
  he is wearing his watch.  Never mind.  Others follow suit
  and begin to trickle into the white surf.

145 BOAT #2
  145

  Four State Police with their 30.06's stowed discreetly under
  their seats.  As a Beering State Policeman talks to Brody on
  the Walkie-Talkie, we notice Boat #5, a short-range speedster,
  working the repellent line.

           BEERING POLICEMAN
       We're putting the fresh cans on,
       Brody.
         (takes beer
         from ice chest)
       Calm down, will you?
         (shouting to
         Boat #5)
       You guys want a beer?

146 BOAT #5
  146

  Two men and a boat-load of canisters.  One holds up the nylon
  repellent line with a pole as the other replaces a can and
  shouts back.

           SAILOR
       I want a pair of rubber gloves.

  To demonstrate what he means, he holds up two hands, black
  with dye.  A wet can of Budweiser tumbles into one of them.

  Sailor's Walkie-Talkie squawks like a strangled chicken.

           VOICE
         (Walkie-Talkie)
       Daisy to Blimp...Daisy to Blimp...
       thirty yards off my port side....

  The two sailors turn to port.

  Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works
  the sonar.

           HENDRICKS
       Anything?  Thought I saw a shadow.
       Over.

  Pan to the water.

148 INT. BLIMP
  148

  A breathtaking view.  The blimp spotter looks down with
  naked eye and binoculars.

           BLIMP SPOTTER
       Nothing from up here, Daisy.  Over.

150 ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY
  150

  He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the
  happy hordes.

           VOICES
       Who's scared to go in!  I was in!
       Up to your knees, yeah -- So
       come with me -- I'll go again.
       How far?  Etc., etc.

  A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.
  They are hauling it toward the surf.

           BRODY
       Hey Mikey -- !

  Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

           BRODY
       You're not going to the ocean
       with that, are you son?

           MICHAEL
       I'm all checked out for light
       surf and look at it.

           BRODY
       Do me this favor just once.  Use
       the ponds.

           MICHAEL
       Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

           BRODY
       Just a favor for your old man.

           MICHAEL
         (confused)
       Sure, Dad.

151 SWIMMERS AND SURFERS
  151

  A surfer waving to impress his girlfriend on the beach.  He
  dives off his board and swims around the black dye.

           COUNTY POLICEMAN
         (through loudhailer)
       Not so close to the line, please....

  The eighteen-year-old surfer submerges, comes up all inky.
  His girlfriend laughs, impressed.

152 TV CREW - NEAR WATER
  152

  Clowning, posing, boasting for the cameras, dozens of
  youngsters ride in baby waves, stand on their heads, on
  the shoulders of friends, wave, swim out, kick up the water.
  The TV cameramen are going crazy.  Burning film.  Zooming.

153 REPELLENT LINE - SURFER AND COUNTY POLICEMAN
  153

  The Surfer won't leave the area.

           COUNTY POLICEMAN
         (through loudhailer)
       Get clear of the repellent line,
       son!

  Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Blimp Spotter's
  voice overloads the speaker.

           BLIMP SPOTTER
       Blimp to Daisy!  Red Four, Red Four!

154 BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

  Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

       Where --- ?

           BLIMP SPOTTER
       Went under your -- There!

  The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales.  A slick
  black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

           SONAR OPERATOR
       Jesus Christ ---

155 BEACH - BRODY
  155

  Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying
  to transmit.

           BRODY
       Everybody out!  Out of the water,
       please -- leave the water, please ---

  Hooper is on his feet.  The lifeguard next to him begins
  blowing on his whistle.

156 CLOSE - BRODY
  156

  shouting hysterically into his Walkie-Talkie.

           BRODY
       No whistles!  No whistles!

157 THE BEACH
  157

  Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see.  More
  whistles, and they start toward shore.  The loudhailers sound-
  ing more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one person
  after another.  Entire groups of people begin pulling toward
  shore, some of them obviously trying to control a growing
  hysteria in others.

158 BOATS #6 AND #7
  158

  are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if track-
  ing an underwater shadow.  The fin is beyond the repellent
  cordons and heading into the crowds.

159 THE WATER - BATHERS
  159

  People begin screaming.  Kids are suddenly separated from
  their parents.  Others seem to forget how to swim.  One
  myopic little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins
  to cry in blinded panic.

160 BOATS #2, #3, #4
  160

  The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too
  many civilians create a hazard.  The Coast Guardsmen attempt
  to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing
  area and the heaving fin.

161 THE WATER - BATHERS
  161

  This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown
  headlong water panic.  Screaming vacationers claw their way
  over the bodies of the less able.  Some literally attempt to
  walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others
  pulling for dry land.

162 CLOSEUPS - PANIC
  162

  Horrified faces.  Some are stunned and wandering in slow,
  tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.
  Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

  Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

  Brody enters shot, yelling into his Walkie-Talkie, Hooper
  charges past him to help an old man out of the water.  He
  returns to pull several others to their feet.

163 EXT. - THE BEACH
  163

  Hooper keeps plunging in, dragging the helpless from the surf.
  Tears well in Brody's eyes.  The screaming is deafening.  The
  TV unit pushes past Brody.

           INTERVIEWER
         (pointing)
       Zoom in!  Over there!

  One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely
  still.  A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against
  each other.

  Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

  The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

164 ANGLE - BATHING AREA
  164

  The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast
  Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line.  All
  boats converge on the dynamic fin.  Men raise their guns
  to fire.  Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely
  calculated fashion.

165 CLOSE - FIN
  165

  It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny
  blue snorkel.  Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom
  we will recall from the coven behind the dune.  The fin bobs
  back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially sub-
  merged surfboard.  One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

166 YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW
  166

  Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him.  Surround-
  ing him on three sides.  Some of the policemen start to
  lower their guns -- struck dumb.

167 CLOSE - YOUNGSTER
  167

  his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his
  hands in unconditional surrender.

168 ANGLE - ESTUARY
  168

  The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.
  Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach
  panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl
  points.

169 A BLACK DORSAL FIN
  169

  is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

170 ANGLE - POND
  170

  Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.
  Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own
  neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by
  it.  The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them.
  They are not yet aware.  The fin seems to circle and return.
  It heads toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets
  in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of
  coffee when he is "bumped."  The entire boat is overturned.
  Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow
  lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.
  Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

  Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between
  them crossing back.  Michael freezes.  The fin comes directly
  at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could
  touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and
  panicked weekend novice.  Catches him.  Michael watches.
  That all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off
  scream -- the head and upper torso of the novice passing
  Michael swiftly as though being carried off -- a current
  of blood trailing around.

  The renewed cry of SHARK!  SEMENTIA POND!

171 CLOSE - BRODY
  171

  He turns.  Oh God!  Running through the slogging sand.

172 CLOSE - COAST GUARDSMEN IN PICKET BOAT
  172

           COAST GUARDSMAN
       Block the estuary!

  Three boats racing to carry out the orders.  The black fin
  repassing the two children, racing to get out.  One rowboat
  reaches the mouth before the others.  The fin won't veer off.
  It smacks into the little vessel, tearing off the bow and
  beaching it in its wake.  Racing into open water.  Blood
  leavings.

173 CLOSE - HOOPER
  173

  He is pulling Michael out of the water as Brody runs up.
  Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at
  nothing.

           HOOPER
         (feeling his face)
       He's in shock.  Get blankets!

  People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their
  hands.  They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet
  raised above his head.

           HOOPER
       I can read signals in the water --
       when they're around -- when they
       leave.  I saw the signals.  It
       moved on.  They reported an attack
       up the coast, toward Ipswitch, Maine
       today.  Oh, Jesus, Martin, I'm sorry.

174 INT. QUINT'S SHACK - DAWN
  174

  The 1940's hit HUBBA, HUBBA, HUBBA blares from the new stereo.
  Barbara Walters blares from the new color TV.

  Brody has the look of a man who has gone without sleep for
  two days.  He slouches in the fighting chair, watching Quint
  who is shoving Salvatore toward the door.

           QUINT
         (shouting over the noise)
       You know which cans, stupid -- the
       whale meat.  Get 'em out of the
       deep freeze and on board.

  This done, Quint picks up a harpoon, tests the point.
  Sharpens it on a shark hide.

           QUINT
       And where would you like this shark
       delivered, sir?

           BRODY
         (even)
       Anywhere we can see it's dead.

           QUINT
         (looking at TV)
       You want him gift-wrapped?

  Brody rises to go.

           BRODY
       Call me.  Soon as you have some news.

  Quint talks past him in a load open voice.

           QUINT
       What is it now?!

  We see Salvatore, afraid of him, but resolved.

           SALVATORE
       I ain't going.  Ain't goin'.

  Quint snaps the generator off.

           QUINT
         (quiet menace)
       You ain't what??

           SALVATORE
       I ain't that crazy, that's what!
       Now I brung in some mean big mothers
       with you, but I'm resignin' on
       this...no, sir!

           QUINT
         (to his gallery
         of jaws)
       Mutiny on the Bounty!

           SALVATORE
       I don't mess with nothin' built
       like no station wagon, 18 -- 20
       foot ---

           QUINT
         (bored)
       How much do you want?

           SALVATORE
       Not with no man-eater!  He ain't
       gonna live to no reputation on
       me ---

           QUINT
         (sharply, turning
         away)
       Go load up.

           SALVATORE
       That's all I'm gonna do.

  Quint picks up a length of rope and starts to coil it, turns
  to Brody.

           QUINT
       Might have to wait till I dig up
       another ---

           BRODY
       I'll go.

  Quint takes him in with a tight smile.  He tosses Brody the
  length of rope.

           QUINT
       Tie me a barrel knot.

  Brody feels useless holding the rope end.

           BRODY
       I really want to go, Mr. Quint.

           QUINT
         (ignoring him)
       Five lengths of half-inch...twenty
       number 14's, straight gaff ---

           BRODY
         (leaving)
       I'll get a pro to come along.

  Quint runs through his check list...to himself.  Pan down to
  the floor and an arsenal of hand-to-shark weaponry.

           QUINT
       Flying gaffs, tail rope, eye-splices,
       M-One, pliers, irons.

              CUT TO

175 EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - DAY
  175

  Hooper's fighting gear is on deck.  His colleague from Woods
  Hole looks at him with some dismay as they go over the check
  list of fighting gear from the Oceanographic Institute.  The
  Colleague, in a smaller boat alongside, hands him the last
  few bits and pieces.

           HOOPER
         (grim)
       Powerhead, C.O.2 darts...hypo...
       regulator...tanks...depth gauge....

  The Colleague glances up toward the flybridge and Quint.
  Salvatore goes back and forth rolling on chum barrels.

           COLLEAGUE
       You shouldn't be in on this, Matt.
         (pause, watches)
       Hunting anything down -- I mean,
       that's not our area.

           HOOPER
         (signing receipt)
       Maybe I'm in the wrong area.

  Quint looks down at the undersea cage that is sitting on the
  transom of the Orca.

           QUINT
       What's this glamour-boy...a portable
       shower?

           HOOPER
         (shakes hands with
         Colleague, who pushes
         off, shaking his head)
       Thanks.  I'll see you.

           QUINT
       Huh?

           HOOPER
         (disinterested in
         what he thinks)
       Anti-shark cage.

           QUINT
         (smiles)
       And you're inside that -- in the
       water?

           HOOPER
       If necessary.

           QUINT
         (smiles, nodding)
       You're in the water with the shark.

           HOOPER
       That's right.

  With an operatic gesture, Quint sings down to him in his best
  voice.

           QUINT
         (soulfully)
       'Believe me, if all those endearing
       young charms...
       That I gaze on so fondly today....'

           HOOPER
         (glancing toward pier)
       Let's go.

176 ANGLE - PIER
  176

  Brody is walking down the pier, bundled in foul-weather
  clothes like a tenderfoot Sea Scout.  He carries a shopping
  bag and an overnight kit.  Quint can't help himself -- he
  guns the Orca's diesel engines to sound like a wolf whistle.

           QUINT
       Well...shiver me timbers!

  Brody is helped unsteadily into the boat by Salvatore, who then
  leaps lightly to the dock and casts off with style.  Even now
  Brody is beginning to look sick.  He holds onto the hatch
  handle.

           QUINT
         (to Brody)
       Bow.  Stern.  Aft.  Forward --
       Port -- Starboard.  Got it?...Good!
         (yells over engine
         noise to Salvatore)
       Missing a great adventure, Sal!

  Salvatore waves and smiles as the boat pulls away.

           SALVATORE
       You bet, Mr. Quint! Bye!  Bye!

  The Orca chugs past the dock and out toward the narrow
  breakwater.

  (NOTE:  TO BE INSERTED -- THE BLUE SHARK FRENZY, PER BENCHLEY'S
  NOVEL, TO GET THE THIRD ACT UNDER WAY.)

177 EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON
  177

  The Orca is drifting in neutral.  The ocean is like gelatin,
  the sun sucking heat waves from its surface.  Brody at the
  stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further sun-
  burn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:  the
  ladling out of chum.  Brody is reeling with nausea.  Hooper
  is up at the wheel on the flybridge.  He dons a baseball cap
  and aviator's sunglasses.  Quint is firmly situated in the
  fighting chair, reeling in the bait.  All three have the look
  of being on open water for the better part of the day, with
  no luck.

           QUINT
         (to himself)
       That don't tempt him either, huh?

  He hauls in the bait.  Two mackerel, barely alive.

           QUINT
       We'll find him something.

  Hooper studies this man Quint as he flings aside the mackerel.
  Brody has stopped chumming and is retching over the side.

           QUINT
         (yelling at Brody)
       Keep that chum going!  We got five
       good miles, don't break it!

  Brody opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and
  some Old Spice after-shave.  He pours the after-shave into the
  cloth, presses it to his nose, and resumes ladling.

  Quint almost trips over Hooper's tanks as he walks to the chum
  barrels.  He roughly kicks them aside.

           QUINT
       Fancy goddam toys....

           HOOPER
         (jumping up)
       Careful!  Compressed air -- you
       crack that and it explodes like a
       bomb!

           QUINT
         (mutters)
       Cluttering up my deck ---

  Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled squid
  from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook rig.

           HOOPER
         (distaste)
       That from a pilot whale too?

           QUINT
         (deftly slicing whale)
       Can't you tell?  Here ---

  He holds up the strip of whale.  Quint has sculpted it into
  the outline of a whale.

           QUINT
       Cute, huh?
         (to Brody)
       The expert don't approve.

  Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

           QUINT
       Now, you swim down and...
         (kisses the bait)
       give a nice big kiss to Mr. White ---

           BRODY
         (croaky)
       You still think it's all the way
       out here?

           QUINT
         (snapping bait to
         his leader)
       I think like they do, Chief.

           HOOPER
       And they have brains the size of
       a radish.

  Quint gets a big laugh out of this, and sits in the fighting
  chair.  He casts off, murmuring as the line feeds out.

           QUINT
       Now if he weren't around, we'd of
       hooked something else by now,
       wouldn't we?  But he scared 'em
       all away.  Yeah, didn't you?  Yeah,
       I know you, you poor lonesome son
       of a bitch...come to pappa, you ---

  The line whizzes off the reel.  Brody jumps up.  Quint puts
  his hand on the drag and addresses the situation softly.

           QUINT
       Atta baby -- he'll gulp it down
       now...
         (making gulping noises)
       Hoooooo!

  Quint tightens drag and strikes.  The line goes whizzing out.
  Brody runs to Quint's side.

           BRODY
       You got it?

           QUINT
         (turning with the pull)
       Get behind me, dummy!
         (shouts to Hooper
       Reverse her and turn -- he's taking
       too much line!
         (to Brody)
       Wet my reel, quick!

  Brody pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.
  Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes direc-
  tion.

           QUINT
         (straining, muscles
         popping
       Starboard, for Chris'sake ---

  Hooper steers it sharply.

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Half-speed there....

  Again the line changes direction, down this time.

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Neutral!
         (to the sea)
       Where the hell is he going?

  Quint reeling in like mad.

           QUINT
       Oh, this ain't foolin' me --
         (rod arcs down
         with a surge)
       Sure -- try it!

  The line rushes out and now there is less tension.  Quint is
  horsing up and down, reeling in.

           QUINT
       Makin' believe it's easy now.

  The line is almost vertical now, and Quint shows a hint of
  bafflement.  He reels in suspiciously.

           QUINT
       Gettin' ready to run again -- no?
       No?
         (suspicious)
       What's he playin' here?
         (reels in furiously,
         to Hooper)
       Put the gloves on!
         (to fish)
       Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
         (to Hooper)
       Down here!  Do like I told you!

  Hooper is rushing down.

           HOOPER
       Can't bring him up so quick ---

           QUINT
         (bathed in sweat;
         hauling, reeling)
       How do you know!  How do I know!

  The leader shows above the water line.  Brody is wide-eyed,
  waiting for that first look.

           BRODY
       He's nearly up ---

           QUINT
         (to Brody)
       Unbuckle me -- fast!
         (to Hooper)
       Grab the leader.  He ain't normal,
       this one...they never --
         (to Hooper)
       Snap it on, jerk!

  Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

           QUINT
       Watch your hands --
         (suddenly to Brody)
       Grab onto this!

  Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily clutch-
  ing at the big rod, appalled.  Quint skips away for a harpoon.
  He picks one from a row of twelve, turns....

  That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing
  backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's
  forehead, drawing blood.  Quint snatches up the rod and
  reels in.  The wires have been bitten through.

           QUINT
         (addressing the ocean)
       Sure...you're havin' a ball!
         (to Hooper, still
         sprawled on deck)
       Get back up here!

           BRODY
       He's hurt....

           HOOPER
         (stunned)
       I'm okay....

           BRODY
       What's the point with hooks and
       lines ---

           QUINT
       Don't tell me my business!
         (to Hooper, points)
       Quarter-mile, that way.  Full
       throttle.

  Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys.  Brody watches
  Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

           BRODY
         (nursing forehead,
         gesturing at rod
         and reel)
       I don't understand though...How you
       expect to ---

           QUINT
       This tricks him to the surface, got
       that?  Then I can jab him, under-
       stand?
         (goes to flybridge,
         muttering)
       Think I'm gonna haul it in like a
       catfish?

  Brody begins to apply cream to his sunburned nose.

178 ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT
  178

           QUINT
         (suddenly, pointing)
       Over there!

           HOOPER
       Why over there?

           QUINT
         (still looking)
       At least you handle the boat all
       right.

           HOOPER
       I can do more than that.  Look,
       Quint, I brought along a ---

           QUINT
       Stop.  Here...Cut the engine.

  Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down.  He stands
  stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.
  Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it over
  to the chair.  About to sit down, he freezes.

179 CLOSE - QUINT
  179

  looking stunned.

180 CLOSE - BRODY
  180

  moving back, eyes wide.

181 CLOSE - HOOPER
  181

  moving closer, aghast.

182 COMBINED POINT OF VIEW
  182

  We see the shark.  First the jet-black fin...then the head
  and upper jaws, twenty yards off.  It finally submerges, veer-
  ing off to one side with a neat slap of its tail.

183 ANGLE - QUINT
  183

  He puts the rod away.

           QUINT
       Jesus.  I heard they got that big....

           HOOPER
       Closer to thirty feet....

           QUINT
         (knowingly)
       Twenty-five.  And three tons of
       him there.

           HOOPER
         (to himself)
       What's the formula...?
         (calculates
         in his head)
       Girth, say 150 inches.  Squared
       and...divide by 800 -- that's six
       one, five...6150 by 2000 --
         (stops, wryly)
       Just over three tons.

  Quint snorts and dumps the chum overboard.  Flings in the
  two mackerel.

           BRODY
       Where'd it go?

  Hooper is rummaging in his gear.  Brody watches him locate a
  small waterproof signal light.  He starts to attach it to
  the first barrel.  Quint, who has been scanning the sea, spins
  around.

           QUINT
       Don't monkey with none of my gear!

           HOOPER
         (trying to be patient)
       Your harpoons are attached to
       these. right?
         (indicates barrels)
       They pop up and drag on him, drag
       on him till he's through -- isn't
       that the idea?

           QUINT
       You can't improve on it!

  Hooper switches on the signal light.  It pulses a glow that
  hurts the eyes even in broad daylight.

           HOOPER
       What if we have to follow him?

  Quint breathes in smoke until his tongue catches fire.

           QUINT
       Sonny -- take that, and your
       formulas, and your cage -- take
       your whole halfass hardware store
       here and ---

  A whale of a thump jolts the Orca.  Quint grabs for a harpoon.
  Brody pulls his snub-nose special from his shopping bag.
  Hooper sees the panic on Brody's face and reaches a hand out
  to him.

           HOOPER
       Put that away!

  Quint, on the pulpit, harpoon poised.

           QUINT
       Once more...once more!

  WHUMP!  Quint almost takes a tumble into the water.  We see
  the glistening back and fin below him.  HE PLANTS THE HARPOON.
  The Great White slaps the transom with its tail and sounds.

184 INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL
  184

  The rope reels out in a blur, and Hooper pins Brody out of
  the way of the spinning coils -- just in time.  The barrel
  with flasher attached literally somersaults out of the boat,
  missing both men's faces by seven inches.

  Quint is already poised, feet planted, with harpoon number
  two.

185 ANGLE - OCEAN
  185

  The barrel skips like a flat rock over the surface of the
  water, then unexpectedly vanishes under the water.

           QUINT
         (poised)
       He can't stay down, swimmin' with
       that on!  Wait till I stick him
       with two!  That'll worry him!  Come
       on, upstairs!  What's he waitin' for?!
       He can't keep down this long!

  Brody and Hooper enter the shot behind him.  The sun is low-
  slung over the horizon.

           BRODY
       Why don't we go in?  Have a crack
       tomorrow....?

           QUINT
         (doesn't turn)
       We are stayin' out here till I
       got him!

186 ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY
  186

  They exchange looks.  "He's nuts."

187 EXT. ORCA - ON OPEN SEA - NIGHT - CLOSE - BRODY
  187

  asleep on deck.  The day has taken its toll.  Brody is riding
  the crest of some bad dreams, on the verge of waking at any
  moment.

188 ANGLE - QUINT AND HOOPER
  188

  Both sit on the transom.  Hooper takes a long pull from a
  bottle of Quint's home brew.  Quint is railing at him, both
  a little smacko.

           QUINT
       Close call, my ass.  A baby dogfish
       in a laboratory?  See this thumb?

  Quint flaunts his thumb, a checkerboard of scar tissue.

           HOOPER
         (handing back the
           bottle)
       You've got the monopoly, huh?  Here!

  Hooper rolls up his trouser leg boasting a crescent scar on
  his calf.

           HOOPER
       Look at this one.

           QUINT
         (snorts)
       Beauty mark.

  Quint starts to pull up his own pant leg.

           HOOPER
       Bull-shark scraped me.  I was down
       getting samples, and he ---

           QUINT
         (puts his leg on
         Hooper's lap)
       Mako!  Match that!

  A slow mischievous grin stains Hooper's soggy face.  He slowly
  unbuttons his shirt, knowing an ace beats the three of club.
  An S-shaped white scar on his side says "gin."

           HOOPER
       Eight-foot moray eel -- right
       through the suit, buddy....

  Quint staggers to his feet, begins undoing his belt, undoes
  his zipper.

           QUINT
       You're in one piece, ain't you?
       Here me lovely!

  Quint pulls down one side of his pants to his hip.  It looks
  like a small piece of him was cored out.

           HOOPER
       Minor League.  Where's it from?

           QUINT
       Tillie Schwab -- Newark, New Jersey.

  Both laugh, as Hooper pull his shirt down over his left
  shoulder.

           HOOPER
       Right!  You want to play dirty -- ?
         (displays tiny scar)
       Standing in line for The Exorcist!

  More laughter.  Quint takes off his shoe.

           QUINT
       I got a toe that'll wipe the floor
       with you ---

  Hooper, laughing, undoes his belt.

           HOOPER
       A what?  You got a what?

189 ANGLE - QUINT
  189

  Something catches his eye and sobers him.

           QUINT
       He's up again.

190 ANGLE - SEA
  190

  The stroboscopic signal-light surfaces at the horizon.

           QUINT
         (grudgingly)
       Very handy light, I'll say that.

           HOOPER
         (feeling macho)
       Let's move in on him.

           QUINT
         (shakes head)
       Not till I can see him good.
         (a long look,
         a hint of worry)
       Even the one'll keep pullin' him up.
       But he'll need three, maybe four.
       Most I ever used was two.
         (swigs from bottle)
       Bastard ran me halfway to Liverpool.

           HOOPER
       You kill him?

           QUINT
         (still staring)
       Always do, once I stick a barrel on
       'em.
         (back to Hooper)
       No more objections?

  Hooper doesn't replay, Quint needles him.

           QUINT
       Jaws two foot wide.  Real Prestige
       item.

  Hooper shrugs.  Quint hands him the bottle.  Hooper cocks
  his head, noticing a scar patch on Quint's right forearm.

           HOOPER
       How'd you get that one?

  Quint, staring out to sea, doesn't seem to hear Hooper.
  The signal light disappears.

           QUINT
       Down again.

           HOOPER
         (persisting)
       The scar on your arm.

           QUINT
         (detached)
       Had a tattoo there.

           HOOPER
         (jocular)
       Changed your mind about somebody?

           QUINT
         (shaking his head)
       It said 'U.S.S. Indianapolis.'

191 CLOSE - HOOPER
  191

  His face falls as he hears this.  Quint looks at him ironi-
  cally.

           QUINT
       Guess you experts know about that.

  Once again Quint turns his eyes to the sea.

           HOOPER
         (gravely)
       You were on her?  June '45?

           QUINT
         (flat and quiet)
       On her and torpedoed right off her.
       Into the drink with 900 other clowns
       ...Started with 900 anyway...floating
       in that big warm Pacific.
         (the light surfaces again)
       Must have been like a dinner bell
       in there...Explosions, and half
       the guys bleeding.  Soon as the
       sharks came homing in on us, we
       went by the Manual, of course...
       Kept trying to float in groups...
       doin' what if said, splash at 'em,
       yell at 'em, hit 'em on the nose,
       they won't bother you...all that.
       They tore apart about a hundred
       men, the first night.  And pretty
       soon, when they stepped it up, and
       you'd feel 'em bump you, and guys'd
       get pulled down a couple of yards
       away, and it got to two days...and
       three...Well, some fellas couldn't
       take it no more, just peeled off
       their life-jackets, got it over with
       ...We were in the water 110 hours.
       Sharks averaged six men an hour.
         (nails Hooper
         a hard look)
       They're all experts.
         (spits in the ocean)

           HOOPER
         (weakened by the story)
       Jesus, Quint!  You can't blame ---

  Hooper is interrupted by the boom and banshee cries of
  a distant whale.

192 ANGLE - BRODY
  192

  springs out of his shallow sleep.

           BRODY
       What --  What the hell --- ?

           HOOPER
         (depressed)
       A whale's out there.

  Quint sits in the fighting chair.

           QUINT
       So is he.

193 ANGLE - SEA
  193

  The light has surfaced a quarter of a mile away.

           QUINT
       Go on and sleep, the two of you.

  Brody sinks back, half awake and panting from his burst of
  fright.  Hooper looks at Quint a long time, suddenly a
  stranger again, then beds himself down in the balmy night
  air.  Quint starts to doze, massaging his missing tattoo.

              CUT TO

194 EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT
  194

  The Orca sits on unruffled waters.  A planetarium of star-
  life overhead with shooting stars, every now and again
  making incisions into the heavens and leaving green trails
  behind.  All is quiet, not a breath of wind.

  The barrel's strobe light pops into foreground, CLOSE.  It
  heads toward the Orca, carving neon blue phosphorescence
  into the water.  The massive dorsal fin surfaces in the
  night and circles the Orca, leaving phosphorescence in its
  broad wake.  The night skies, the silent waters are now
  alive in dancing light.

195 ANGLES - THE MEN
  195

  as the sleep.  A SOUND is heard.  A low protracted scraping.
  No one wakes.  The sound returns.  Another SCRAPE.  A SCRATCH-
  ING noise...almost sounds like CHEWING.  Then a gentle BUMP
  at the stern.  Quint stirs.  Brody turns over.  Hooper is
  sleeping soundly.  Then....

  A seizure of violent shaking.  A horrible splintering and
  popping noise.  Quint half falls, half springs, out of the
  chair.  Hooper is on his feet, but loses his footing.  The
  Orca is again bumped from underneath.  Brody holds on, his
  gun in hand.  Quint pulls out his M-1.

           QUINT
       Start the engine!

  Hooper is on the flybridge in six bounds.  Quint fires sea-
  ward over the transom.  The engine starts, but something in
  it sounds wrong.

           QUINT
       Cut it!  Cut it!

  Quint cranes to look down and around, but no light can be
  found.

           QUINT
       I don't know where he is!  Ripped
       something loose -- shaft or some-
       thin'.

  He hefts up a deckboard, pokes his small flashlight into
  the cavity.

           HOOPER
       I told you I have things to kill it
       with...take over up there, I can --
       Quint!

           QUINT
         (slams down board)
       Start the pump, goddammit!

  Quint can't hide his fear now.

           BRODY
       Are we leaking?

  Sound -- pumps starting.

           QUINT
       We'll stay afloat.  Watch for
       the barrel ---

           BRODY
       Can't I bail or something?

  Quint takes Brody by the arm and sits him down, pointing
  to starboard.

           QUINT
       Keep your eyes open, that's all --
       out there!
         (to Hooper)
       And you keep looking that way,
       killer!

  Quint takes up the opposite position and loads his M-1.
  Brody checks his gun.  Hooper looks with binoculars.

           QUINT
       And nobody sleeps.  Nobody!

196 ANGLE - ORCA
  196

  The three men standing sentinel.  Stars...quiet seas...
  phosphorescence lighting up the water.  HEAR the whale cry-
  ing from far away.

197 EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN
  197

  Brody leans against the windshield on the flybridge.  His
  arms hoist binoculars to his eyes.  Visible without binoculars
  is the signal-light and barrel, not moving, two hundred yards
  astern.  An angry racket filters up from below deck -- Quint
  is effecting engine repairs the only way he knows how.  Brody
  has learned a neat sailor's trick and nimbly slides down the
  hand piping, his feet avoiding the steps.  He sidles next to
  Hooper, who is struggling into his full wet suit.

           QUINT (o.s.)
       It moving?

           BRODY
         (loud and off)
       No -- still there!

  Hooper is busy attaching the cage to the ginpole.  He is full
  of purpose, his hands working against the clock, short glances
  to the hatch from where Quint can be heard, cursing and wrench-
  ing.

           BRODY
       Please, Matt, don't get him sore.
       He's loony enough.

  Hooper tests the rope, inspects his gear, selects a steel
  pole and opens a tiny green felt case.

           BRODY
       Put all that stuff away before he
       finds out.

198 INSERT - GREEN FELT CASE

  Hooper opens it, removing a deadly-looking syringe head.

           HOOPER
         (grim)
       He had a turn, now I'll have a turn.
         (mounting it
         on steel pole)
       Maybe you should have a turn, too.

  Brody tries to reason, when:

199 ANGLE - QUINT
  199

  emerges dirty, red-eyed and haggard, pauses to take it all
  in.

           QUINT
       What is this?

           HOOPER
         (without looking up)
       Strychnine nitrate, 20 CC's.

           QUINT
       Wear all the Batman costumes you
       want, sport.  But don't you inter-
       fere with me.

  Quint starts to climb the bridge.

           HOOPER
         (to Quint)
       All you need to do is lower me in ---

           QUINT
         (muttering
           to himself)
       I need a transom that don't leak
       every time that --
         (starts engine)
       -- shaft goes around --
         (an uneven sputter)
       -- Bent!  Seams splitting open
       there -- !

  Quint finesses the Orca "slow ahead" toward the barrel.  The
  engine sounds like a hamster treadmill.  Hooper climbs up
  beside him.

           HOOPER
       You know he'll go for the cage ---

           QUINT
       Not today, doc.  No injections.

           HOOPER
       I can finish him in sixty seconds.

           QUINT
         (listening
         to engine)
       Whole goddam housing's loose!  'He'
       can hear it, too.

           HOOPER
       Can't you stop this Moby Dick crap?!

           QUINT
       We do this the way I know how.

  Quint cuts the engine once alongside the barrel.  Hooper
  barely controls himself.  Climbs down.

  Quint follows after him, putting a cautioning hand on Hooper's
  shoulder to walk softly, then motions Brody to stay on the
  flybridge and keep his eyes peeled.

200 QUINT - HOOPER
  200

  Tiptoe to the stern, Quint intercepting a harpoon along the
  way.  Hooper leans way out over the transom and poles the
  barrel closer.  It bobs around easily, arousing Quint's sus-
  picions.

           QUINT
         (softly)
       Playin' possum....

  Hooper poles up the slick nylon rope, leaving the barrel
  untouched in the water.

           QUINT
       Pull up easy -- only want to goose
       him up.  Second you feel he's run-
       ning, drop it...If you want any
       hands left.

  Hooper starts hand-reeling in.  Surprisingly, there is no
  resistance.  Both men share perplexed looks.  Then Quint
  reaches over, his whole body leaning over the side, putting
  down his harpoon.

           QUINT
       Here -- gimme.  I don't get what
       he's....

201 WATER - ANGLE
  201

  Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching
  the water on the aft side.  From the opposite starboard
  direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great
  White.  First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper
  border of wide, grinning teeth.  It knifes through the water
  in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed
  toward the unsuspecting men.

202 CLOSE - BRODY
  202

  His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of
  direction.

           BRODY
         (top of his lungs)
       Shark!  Starboard!  It's under
       you -- !

203 CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT
  203

  They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them
  from instant decapitation.  The Great White passes the
  transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet
  of chewed off cable.  The monster rolls on its side and looks
  at them as it passes.  Then, with a great sweep of its tail,
  it lashes the side of the boat, ripping the rope from Quint's
  hand and shearing off five square yards of paint like a lathe.
  It makes a wide arc out to sea, only the fin showing now, and
  begins to circle around the boat.  Quint notices his hand,
  palm cut and bleeding, realizes he came that close to losing
  his whole hand.  He has never been more dangerous.

           QUINT
         (to Brody)
       Haul in that rope -- it can foul
       us!
         (screaming
         to Hooper)
       Start the engine -- !

  Brody and Hooper exchange places.  The engine starts with a
  terrible grinding.

           QUINT
         (roaring)
       Easy!  It'll tear right out!

           BRODY
         (next to him,
         hauling in rope)
       We can't do it ourselves....

           QUINT
         (seeing red)
       Shut up!

           BRODY
       He chewed through this, he cracked
       your boat -- radio in for help ---

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Pump her out a little...!

           BRODY
       I mean it!  Send out an S.O.S.!

           QUINT
         (spitting)
       Don't make me laugh when I'm working.

           BRODY
         (sudden resolve)
       I'll do it.

  Brody heads off for the cabin.

204 QUINT - CLOSE
  204

  A perfectly terrible look comes over him.  He raises up and
  starts after Brody.  Brody disappears into the cabin.  Quint
  pauses outside and sees:

205 INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT
  205

  his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

206 INT. RADIO SHACK
  206

  Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on the
  complex console.

           QUINT (o.s.)
       Beg your pardon ---

207 ANGLE - DOORWAY
  207

  Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door,
  raising his bat.

           QUINT
       Duty first and pleasure after ---

208 CLOSE - BRODY
  208

  looking up in horror.

209 CLOSE - QUINT
  209

  Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can muster.

  Crash!

  Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of
  metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the ship-
  to-shore radio.

  Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him
  the bat.

           QUINT
         (leaving the cabin)
       Excuse me!

  If he were ten years older, Brody would be on the floor with
  heart failure.

210 CLOSE - HOOPER
  210

  urgently pointing.

           HOOPER
       Coming right to us!

  Quint grabs up his harpoon.

           QUINT
       No -- comin' at us!  Slow ahead
       he'll slam us, head on --
         (the engine
         clanks)
       Slower!  Throttle back ---

211 ANGLE - OVER THE BOW
  211

  The shark is closing the gap, faster.

           QUINT
         (raising harpoon)
       Hard to port!

  Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot
  at the upward rolling flank.  He sinks it with careful pre-
  cision.

           QUINT
       Try shakin' that out!

  Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and
  the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before
  plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

           BRODY
         (shouting to Hooper)
       This won't kill it!

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Swing around!  After him!

212 ON THE FLYBRIDGE
  212

  Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel.  Diving
  down.  Up again -- Quint prepares another iron.

           QUINT
       More gas...go to half!  Get me
       right alongside him ---

  The engine thuds and knocks.

           HOOPER
         (shouting down)
       We can't rev it up this high ---

  Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

           QUINT
       Watch it!

  Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

           QUINT
       Atta boy!

  Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head.  The
  Great White breaks water and....

           QUINT
       Take two, they're small!

  He sinks it deep.  We hear shots.  As the new rope whips out,
  Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, clutching the
  steel cage with one hand, firing his pistol at the shark
  with the other.

  Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the
  barrel goes over.

           HOOPER
         (shouting at Brody)
       Don't shoot him any more!  He's
       crazy on his own blood already!

           BRODY
       I can't stand here doing nothing!

           QUINT
       Order in the court!

213 WATER LEVEL ANGLE
  213

  He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

           QUINT
         (racing over)
       Three'll do it!  He's havin'
       trouble with two!

  He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

           QUINT
       Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

  Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers
  toward the moving barrels.  Quint peers down, steering closer
  and closer.

           QUINT
       Get ready!  Now snag 'em!

  Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for
  dear life as the shark changes course.

           QUINT
       Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto
       the transom -- free ride.

  Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint
  helps out by wheeling in a circle.  He laughs to himself,
  enjoying the spectacle.

214 CLOSE - HOOPER
  214

  securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang
  overboard.  He helps Brody with his chore on a second
  adjacent cleat.

215 WIDE ANGLE - ORCA
  215

  The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the under-
  water force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to and
  fro, up and down, side to side....

216 ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY
  216

  are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward.

217 FLYBRIDGE - QUINT
  217

  sees the fin ahead.  It is pulling the boat.

           QUINT
       Get tired!  That's the idea!
       Here's a little reverse for you!

  The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is
  both horrifying and awesome.  Its jaws break water, snapping
  at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

  Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

           QUINT
       Haul in -- watch the prop!

  At that, Quint slides down to the prow, grabs up an iron.
  It is too light.  He grabs another, finding satisfaction in
  its heft and balance.  The shark can be seen directly ahead,
  threshing closer.

           QUINT
       Now!  Untie 'em!  Quick -- Now!

  He sinks the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing
  shower of spray.

218 HOOPER AND BRODY
  218

  They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are
  stretched too taut.  They jump out of the way as the ropes
  stretch down the side and behind the boat, knocking over
  objects as it skeeters across the deck.  A tight jerking
  motion, and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards.
  And much too fast.  Water is splashing up over the transom
  in its backward wake.

           QUINT
       I said untie them ---

  Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

219 CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS
  219

  A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

  The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood
  spraying -- and the barrels fly into the water.  They dis-
  appear beneath the turbulent grey surface.

  The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat,
  look out at the blank water.

220 ANGLE - OCEAN
  220

  Pop -- pop -- pop.  One, two, three, the barrels surface --
  ready for more.

           QUINT
       He can't go deep now, or far,
       either.  Not with those.  Not for
       long.

  Brody looks down at his feet.  There is salt water up to their
  shoe tops.

           BRODY
       What about us?

           QUINT
         (mentally assessing
         the damage)
       Have to pump her steady, s'all.

  The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water,
  pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Follow him --
         (to Brody)
       You start pumpin' out here.

  Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his 30.06,
  checks the load.

           QUINT
       Maybe a brain shot...one lucky
       hit....

           HOOPER (o.s.)
         (on bridge)
       He's heading under -- !

           QUINT
         (incredulously)
       No way!  He can't!

221 ANGLE - OCEAN
  221

  The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one
  -- two -- three.

           BRODY
       Where'd he go?

  Brody looks around.  Hooper on the flying bridge searching
  in all directions.  Quint is looking more appalled every
  second.

           QUINT
         (helplessly)
       He can't stay down with three
       barrels on him!  What are we
       dealing with here?!  Where is he?!

           BRODY
       Have you ever had one do this?

           QUINT
         (and he means this)
       No!

  BOOMING THUD at the keel.  Brody slides on the wet deck and
  Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

222 HOOPER - FLY BRIDGE
  222

  With him we watch the barrels pop up ahead of the bow then
  veer briskly to the left and plunk down again.

           QUINT
       Follow him!

           HOOPER
       I can't see him!

223 CLOSE - BRODY
  223

  Panic-ridden, barely in control.

           BRODY
       There -- !

  The barrels have surfaced and we see the lengthy shadow passing
  underneath the Orca.  It is incredibly huge, there's always
  more of it.  There is a SCRAPING NOISE.  Quint looks down as
  two of the barrels drag along the sides of the boat.

           BRODY
       He's trying to sink us!

           QUINT
         (to Hooper)
       Dead astern!  Zig-zag!

  There is something different about Quint.  He's quieter now,
  more icily calm.  The colorful cockiness has left him.  Brody
  senses that Quint knows he's in a fight for his life.

  The Orca taking evasive action.  But the three barrels are
  steadily closing the gap.  The engine makes SLOSHING NOISES
  now...missing and backfiring.

           BRODY
       He's chasing us...I don't believe
       it.

           QUINT
       Full throttle -- to port!

224 HOOPER
  224

  He gooses the throttle but the engine only screeches and
  pounds erratically.  The three barrels pass beyond the boat,
  negotiating a tight circle and plowing mercilessly toward
  the Orca.  The tip of the fin aims for the stern.  Quint
  is ready with his rifle.

  The shark breaks water and rises like a rocket, snout, jaw
  and pectoral fins shooting straight up.  We see the smoke-
  white belly, the pelvic fin, as it clears the surface and
  falls sideways drenching Quint, who fires six times.

  The Orca shudders from side to side.  From Hooper's point of
  view we can just discern what is happening.  The shark has
  the lower transom in its jaws and is shaking the boat with
  each jolt of its head.  Quint shoots until spent.  Brody
  seizes a gaff and drives it down at the conical nose again
  and again.

           QUINT
       Throttle back -- !

  When they next peer out, the dorsal fin can be seen gliding
  away, beginning a long circle around the Orca.

  Right about now the Orca's engine breathes its final fumes
  and fails.

225 CLOSE - BRODY AND QUINT
  225

  Utter dismay.  Hooper turns the key, the motor wheezes...but
  the engine is dead.

226 ANGLE - QUINT
  226

  His eyes flick from Hooper to the transom.  It is cracked!
  Then out at the barrels...they don't seem to be moving.

           BRODY
         (noting this)
       Maybe we killed it?

           QUINT
         (don't I wish)
       We didn't kill it.

  In rebuttal the barrels begin to move again, closer, in
  tighter concentric circles.

              CUT TO

227 ON DECK - HOOPER
  227

  slipping into his weight-belt, strapping on his compressed
  air tanks.  Nobody wants to stop him this time...even Quint
  helps him on with things.

           HOOPER
       Your pumps are out too.  Drop me
       down to twenty feet or so, okay?

  Hooper walks over to the cage.  Opens the steel doors and
  closes himself in.

           HOOPER
         (to Quint)
       Try and keep him off me till I'm
       down.

  Quint nods grimly and Hooper brandishes the pole with affixed
  syringe.  He give him a thumbs up and Hooper absently returns
  it.  Quint circles the deck, eye on the barrels.

228 HOOPER AND BRODY
  228

  on opposite sides of the bars.

           HOOPER
         (with a reassuring
         smile)
       Lower away, Chief.

  He pops his mouthpiece between teeth and lowers the face
  mask.  Unsure, Brody manages to undo the knot that starts the
  cage into the ocean.  He and Hooper stare at one another as
  their faces pass, Hooper's moving down, down into the slate-
  grey sea.  Brody curls the rope around his forearm for a
  stronger hold.

           QUINT
       That's the way Chief.

           BRODY
       Live and learn.

229 UNDERWATER - CAGE
  229

  HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

  Submerging.  The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea
  air then...the magnificent innerspace, with bubbles sparkling
  in front of us.

230 ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE
  230

  as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around
  360 degrees.  He removes the rubber guard from the needle and
  waits.

231 EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT
  231

  Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still
  circling.  Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

232 THE SEA
  232

  The barrels have come to a stop.  Delicately, they change
  course and meander toward the lowered cage.

233 UNDERWATER - HOOPER
  233

  His back is to us.  He is just now completing a visual sweep
  and turns, eyes front into closeup and:  fixes wildly on
  something monstrous...and fascinating.

234 HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW
  234

  The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward
  in the blue.  From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly
  -- comes the shark.  It move with no apparent effort, sinuous
  beyond comparison.  As it nears the cage, it turns, and its
  ghastly length passes right in front of him:  first the snout,
  then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

  Hooper tentatively reaches out.  It is too far for the
  strychnine pole.  The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes,
  iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge
  the passing currents with pink.

235 SURFACE
  235

  The trailing barrels GONG and SCRATCH the keel of the Orca
  above.  Brody and Quint leap back.

236 HOOPER - CLOSE
  236

  The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt.  Hooper,
  expecting the shark to attack out of that same general
  direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars,
  breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and...we
  see that the shark attacking from behind him.

  The cage is sent careening.  Hooper grabs the bars for dear
  life.  The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal
  jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending
  the bars like clothes hangers.  Hooper can't turn the point-
  end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the
  non-rational attacker as possible.

  Hooper is trapped.

  The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges again.
  The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, the
  jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, the
  tail thrusting it forward.  Hooper drops the strychnine pole
  between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture depth.

  All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating
  Hooper at the waistline.  Through frantic bubbles Hooper
  fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out
  of the cage.  The shark backpedals with its tail, but the
  broad head won't shake loose.

  Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

238 ANGLE - SHARK
  238

  As spirals of harmless bullets bead the water, the shark twists
  free of the cage and arrows downward after Hooper.

  Hooper nearly recovers the pole.  Again it slips from his
  frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow
  abyss.  Hooper turns and looks up.

  The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

239 SURFACE
  239

  One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls
  taut.

240 HOOPER - DEEP
  240

  Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a
  moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

241 SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT
  241

  The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost
  to the breaking point.  Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul
  up the cage.  Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a
  hand-winch.  The GINPOLE IS SPLITTING!

           QUINT
       Let go of it!

  The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale....
  the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging
  it, but Quint won't give up the winch.  Brody hauls on the
  rope barehanded.

242 UNDERWATER - HOOPER
  242

  maneuvering downward, away from the jaws...Suddenly the crazed
  shark veers upward for the surface.

243 SURFACE - QUINT
  243

  The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding
  it in.  The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks
  water.

  Brody is horrified.  THE CAGE IS EMPTY!

           QUINT
         (a horrible scream)
       He's comin' up --- !

244 MASTER ANGLE
  244

  The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a
  great whooshing noise.  It rises vertically, towering over-
  head, blocking out the sun.  The pectoral fins seem to reach
  forward.  The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto
  the stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly
  missing Quint and Brody.  It drives the stern underwater,
  the ocean pours in over the transom.  The jaws snap from side
  to side.  Brody flounders backwards away from it.  Quint
  gropes for his rifle and fires.  The shark heaves its terrible
  girth and Quint flies backwards onto his harpoon display.

245 CLOSE - QUINT
  245

  Skewered by a Number Twelve iron, Quint gulps blood and
  pitches into the onrushing sea.

246 NIGHTMARE ANGLE - BRODY
  246

  The Orca is tipping backwards, sinking stern first, tipping
  Brody toward the gaping thrusting jaws.  Deck chairs, irons,
  spent cartridges, thermos, beer cans all pour into the
  vacuum of the open gagging jaws.  It wants Brody now, its
  tail keeping him into position.

  Brody is sliding toward it with the rest of the debris as
  the bow raises thirty degrees.  He intercepts one of Hooper's
  compressed air tanks and just as he and everything else pours
  toward the whirlpool and into the jaws, Brody braces himself
  and shoves the tanks at the bottomless pit.  They jam between
  the upper and lower jaws and stick fast.

  The shark twists backward in the water and turns away.  Hooper,
  rising, is peering around for Brody and Quint.  The shark is
  spinning in crazed circles, the head-thrusts indicating that
  it can neither dislodge nor swallow the silver tanks.  It
  bites down at fifteen tons pressure per square inch. The
  TANKS EXPLODE!

247 SURFACE - EXPLOSION
  247

  A thirty-foot geyser of bright red water touches the black
  sky, spreading everywhere, missing nothing.

248 UNDERWATER
  248

  Clouds of blood -- shark's suspended carcass.  Another cloud
  -- Quint suspended.

249 SURFACE - THE ORCA
  249

  sinks with a rumble.

250 CLOSE - HOOPER ON SURFACE
  250

  Raising his mask from the water, he kicks toward Brody.

251 UNDERWATER
  251

  The steel-grey body of the shark is falling away, an apparition
  evanescing into the darkness -- sinking in a slow, graceful
  spiral, stopped by the bobbing barrels.

252 SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER
  252

  Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, in shock.

           BRODY
       Quint...Quint...is he dead?

  Hooper crosses Brody's chest with his left arm, keeping him
  up in the water.

           HOOPER
       Don't talk.  We've got a long way.

253 HIGH SHOT
  253

  The two tiny, miserable heroes, swimming from the debris.

              FADE OUT

           THE END
