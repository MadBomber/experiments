experiments
===========

A diverse collection of code experiments, prototypes, and snippets spanning many topics and technologies.
These projects are often incomplete or exploratory—think of this as a boneyard of corpse flowers and
playgrounds for trying out ideas in Ruby, Python, AWS Lambda, AI/ML, networking, cryptography, and more.

Below is a brief description of each top-level subdirectory:

* **misc_ruby_snippets**: A grab-bag of small Ruby scripts and utilities—everything from FizzBuzz to KML-to-CSV converters, debug helpers, and other quick IRB experiments.
* **av_capture**: Ruby server and client scripts for capturing and previewing audio/video streams, with accompanying tests and usage instructions.
* **event_bus**: A simple Ruby-based pub/sub framework (the `event_bus` gem), including a “Sin City” casino simulation example demonstrating event-driven architectures.
* **nise**: Next Integrated System Environment (NISE) messaging library exploring transports, formats (JSON/XML/binary), and a CLI for running simulations.
* **twilio**: Experimental Ruby scripts and notes for interacting with the Twilio API—sending SMS, validating phone numbers, and building simple phone menus.
* **whenever**: Examples using the `whenever` gem to define and schedule cron jobs in Ruby.
* **markov**: Prototypes for generating random text with Markov chains, including generators for Hacker News titles and meditations.
* **openai**: Ruby scripts and playbooks for working with the OpenAI API—analysis tools, title generators, embedding store examples, and prompt experiments.
* **avahi**: A collection of Avahi (mDNS/zeroconf) network discovery experiments, method interception hacks, and assorted Ruby network utilities.
* **holidays**: Simple scripts and data for holiday-related prompts (writing, market research), embedding stores, and “we are closed” notifications.
* **mail**: Ruby examples for sending and reading email via SMTP/IMAP, plus ActionCable/WebSocket integrations for OpenAI-based mail processing.
* **localai**: Experiments running AI models locally—a toy vector store, text-to-speech, and demo apps.
* **images**: Image-based AI experiments (Q&A, prompt engineering) and example assets for testing.
* **translation**: Ruby experiments using translation gems (Google Translate, etc.) and test harnesses.
* **hello_lambda**: Serverless AWS Lambda “Hello World” prototypes written in Ruby.
* **enigma**: Ruby implementation of the classic Enigma cipher machine for cryptography experimentation.
