# SMELL: I looked at the two examples for using trailblazer one with sinatra the
#        other rails.  They are so far out of date to be worthless out of the box.
#        Also this concept is overly complex in that it ruins the simlicity of sinatra.
#        So far I have found nothing redeaming about the framework.
