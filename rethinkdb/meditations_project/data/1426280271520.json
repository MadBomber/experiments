Is God disappointed in me? If not, where is he in my circumstances?\r\nThe Israelites in Malachi's day asked the same questions as they gazed over the literal ruins of their lives in Jerusalem after their release from captivity in Babylon. And God answered with an assurance so simple and profound: 31 love you2 (Malachi 1:2, NAB). He wasn't concerned by the crumbling walls or making up for lost time, but rather the need for his people to know his love.\r\nGod's answer hasn't changed. He loves us right where we are, as we are today. What we may see as ruins, he sees as building blocks for something greater than we could ever image for ourselves. He wants us to know he is near and that as we shift focus from our messy surroundings to his presence, he will redeem and rebuild the lives he intended\r\nfor us from the beginning.\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"How do I sense God's presence in my troubles?\r\n","prayer":"Lord, thank you for your unfailing love and closeness no matter where we are in life.\r\n","prayer_focus":"Awareness of Godâ€™s love in all circumstances\r\n\r\n","notes":"","previously_published":false,"id":"1426280271520","submission_author":{"email_address":"mlawriting@gmail.com","name":"Megan L.
