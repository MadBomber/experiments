As I walked,  I observed a grandfather who was on an outing with his two small granddaughters. When they neared the road, the grandfather told his younger granddaughter, who had run ahead, \"Don't go crossing the street until I can get there to watch for cars! \"\r\n\r\nIn true kid fashion, the little girl just proceeded to cross the street without looking right or left. There were no cars coming, so she was safe, but the grandfather smiled at me ruefully and said, \"I guess every direction I give her is just an option.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that we often treat God's Word in the same way. Rather than listening to, and living in His Word, we just plunge on, confident that we can make it on our own. Then, when we run into difficulties, we realize that we need His Word to help us to cope with the dangers and pitfalls of life.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, just like the grandfather in this story, God is there to love us, forgive us for our lapses, and protect us, even when we forget and treat His word as an option.","thought_for_the_day":"God's Word is not just an option.\r\n","prayer":"Lord help us to remember every day to study Your Word and remember Your ways to keep our life road safe.\r\n","prayer_focus":"Grandparents and their grandchildren","notes":"","previously_published":false,"id":"1426188054820","submission_author":{"email_address":"w0bud@aol.com","name":"Jayne","legal_name":"Parker","gender":"female","mailing_address":"15879 FishHawk View Drive\r\nLithia, FL 33547","phone_number":"","bio":"n/a","honorific":"Ms."}}
