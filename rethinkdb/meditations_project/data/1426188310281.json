There was many mistakes and it would be submitted on the next day afternoon, so there was no time to fix it. I was very stress. Next day at noon, when I did my side job  as a tutor. One of my student asked me, \"Mom, can you give me the answer, how many five plus two?\". His question made me angry because he was in grade 4 and could answer the question by himself. I answered him, \"You know the answer is seven, why are you still asking me?\" With his smile, he answered me, \"No Mom, this is your math and not God's math. The answer for your math is seven but for God, five plus two is more than five thousands because God's can feed five thousands people only with five breads and two fish\".\r\nHis question and answer made me calm. I prayed for God's helping and finally, Praise The Lord, my lecturer gave me one week more to fix my proposal. Until now, I always remember that God's still do His miracle for those whose hope is in Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"Is anything too hard for the Lord?
