She was efficient and well-liked and her work was impeccable. However, the position was offered to the nieces of a new board member and although unfair and morally wrong, Marie had no choice but to pack up and lave. The way she left, however, was humbling. She cleaned up her computer files and made them accessible to the new employee. She dusted and cleaned her book shelves, leaving newly sharpened pencils plus markers in a colorful receptacle. She made a short guidebook of helpful hints for the next person and on her last day, thanked the people who had given her the opportunity. \r\n\"But why would you do that for them, when they let you go for now reason?\" I questioned.\r\n\"I am going to leave as a Christian,\" she said. \"I want my name to be associated with kindness and to show the love I always felt at my job.\"\r\nIn the book of Esther we read that the Jewish people, about to be eradicated by Haman, were spared due to Esther's and her uncle Mordecai's selfless acts of courage and obedience. When Mordecai became \"Great in the king's house,\" the people were thankful and did acts of kindness amongst themselves and the poor (Esther 9:22 KJV). How Marie behaved during her ordeal gives a glimpse into the power of forgiveness and how Christ's love triumphs over all.","thought_for_the_day":"","prayer":"Lord, help me to inhabit your great love and grace, so that in all circumstances I can turn adversity to good.","prayer_focus":"","notes":"","id":"1426105808539","submission_author":{"email_address":"geniewriter@comcast.net","name":"Jean L.
