On one occasion, as an introduction to our weekly worship service, I used the cover art and the art interpretation of the September/October 2014 issue, as well the analysis of Psalm 143.\r\n\r\nAs we studied the cover art, we identified with the commentary. At times we feel burdened by the pressures of the modern world, sometimes to the point of not having the strength to seek opportunities for help. I encouraged the group to remain steadfast and to remember that thousands, perhaps millions, of people around the world unite and support us in prayer daily. For this we give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nWe closed our service that evening guided by the prayers written by persons around the world.\r\n\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"A shared experience is a shared blessing across the world.","prayer":"Prayer: Thank you, Lord, for resources like The Upper Room and for our sisters and brothers around the world who share their life experiences.
