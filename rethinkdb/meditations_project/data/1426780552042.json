It involves lying on your back on a semi rigid cylinder \u0026 alternatively raising an arm straight up \u0026 pulling up the opposite leg into a bent position. Such action creates the need to maintain balance on the cylinder thereby theoretically improving your core being.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the activity is designed to improve my physical wellbeing, I came to realize thereâ€™s also a spiritual aspect to my exercise movements. As I reach toward the ceiling in my exercise space I also need to reach out on a ongoing basis to God the Father. He desires to be in our lives \u0026 stands ready to welcome us into a close personal relationship. We, however, need to take steps to enter that relationship by actively reaching out to Him. We can do that thru our acceptance of Jesus Christ as our personal Savior \u0026 by striving to adhere to His teachings. \r\n\r\nPhysical \u0026 spiritual wellbeing is readily available. Attaining it requires our reaching out to the available sources. \r\n","thought_for_the_day":"Actively seek God \u0026 He will unite with you.","prayer":"Father God, thank you for your eternal love \u0026 compassion.
