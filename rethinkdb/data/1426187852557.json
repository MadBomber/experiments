On those Days, he became one of the guys. We would get to the lake and set up camp and put the lines in the water. We were ready for a long day of fishing. After about 10 or 15 minutes, Justin (my son) would get bored and pick up rocks and throw them into the water. Then he would watch the ripples go out in all directions. As Christians, we are like those ripples. The word of God is our rock and when we read it and obey it, we go out in all directions and tell other people about God's love and his saving grace. Then they get saved and go out and tell more people about the word of God, who get saved and tell even more people. it becomes a smooth motion like those ripples int he lake. Jesus said in Matthew 28:19: \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" What he was saying is be a ripple and go out to make more ripples, who can go out and make even more ripples. What a wonderful idea.","thought_for_the_day":"","prayer":"Oh God, give me every chance to go out and talk to people and bring them to you, so they in turn can go out and make more \"ripples.\" In Jesus' name.
