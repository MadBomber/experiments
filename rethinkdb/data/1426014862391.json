The driver of the car was traveling at night and the road was dark and covered in fog.  Unfortunately, he was lead to believe that his GPS direction was correct; all the while unaware that the unfamiliar road ahead ended in disaster.\r\nAs I read the newspaper article I began to think how easily we can get misguided or distracted along our way.  Things that the world can offer or other people can persuade us to think that we are making right choices.  But sometimes those options can lead us down roads that are potentially dangerous.\r\nFortunately, through prayer we can ask for daily guidance and wisdom to know which paths could be potentially destructive to ourselves and others.  We can ask for the kind of wisdom that goes beyond human reasoning.  God will show us the way and guide us home.","thought_for_the_day":"Do I pray before making decisions and wait for an answer?","prayer":"Dear heavenly Father, thank you for being the only GPS we'll ever need to guide us through our life. Thank you for your wisdom that shows us what to do when we are faced with making decisions.
