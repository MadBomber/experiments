The words that were spoken in frustration are never usually carried out, but still the person to whom the words were directed has been affected in some way. We've all had moments when we can't believe what's come out of our mouths and would like to take those words back.\r\n\r\nI was reading through the book of Proverbs recently and came across these words (words that I can't remember ever reading before): \"A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver\" (25:11). What a beautiful picture of how our speech can be a treasure in another person's life if we choose to let it. The Bible often uses rich imagery to describe something precious - in this case apples of gold in settings of silver; the result of affirming words that have been thought through before they have left the lips.\r\n\r\nLet's try today to be more thoughtful when we open our mouths and more intentional in making sure that what we say uplifts rather than destroys.\r\n\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"Our tongue can bless or distress; it all depends on the owner.","prayer":" Father, please help me today to choose to honor You and others by what I say.
