I jumped  at the opportunity for a new experience. It was a beautiful day on the water, with calm seas and a clear sky but no fish! I asked him whether it was common not to catch anything. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"That's fishing.\"  Even for an experienced fisher doing everything right, some days there are just no fish to be had. Fishing requires persistence, a focus on good practices, and a sense of peace about the results.\r\n\r\nOur spiritual practices of prayer, worship, holy conversation, and working for justice, to name just a few, often seem like this. Even when we \"do everything right,\" it sometimes feels like we come up empty. Like learning to fish, learning how to be disciples requires persistence, good practice, and a sense of peace about the results. We keep trying, with the faith that even when \"we have worked all night long but have caught nothing,\"  Jesus is present and can surprise us with a bounty of love greater than we could have ever imagined.\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"We can't always see results, but we can have faith that Jesus meets us in our prayer and our work.","prayer":"God, give me the patience to persist in discipleship even when I feel like I'm coming up empty.","prayer_focus":"Those struggling with feelings of spiritual emptiness","notes":"","id":"1426017887268","submission_author":{"email_address":"dhosey2@gmail.com","name":"David Hosey","legal_name":"David Hosey","gender":"male","mailing_address":"711 Simpson Street\r\nGreensboro, NC 27401","phone_number":"","bio":"n/a","honorific":"Mr."}}
