Some folks have asked me if I run with headphones. Negative to that.  How would I be able to have my daily conversations with God if I had these on?\r\n\r\nThe outdoors morning is my \"room\" and I am indeed thankful that God knows me in such a way that He provides me with this quiet time.\r\nThat's not a place where most people would define a prayer setting.\r\n\r\nMy \"God chats\" have run (excuse the pun) from praying for family members or friends needs to asking for guidance and direction.  God is always listening as the dawn is breaking around me. Sometimes answers and results come quickly: while others I still wait for, knowing that I may never have a resolution in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nYour prayer setting is as unique to you as God has made you unique. Where is your room?\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"","prayer":"Lord, I am thankful for the time and the place that You have given me to spend with You.\r\n","prayer_focus":"","notes":"","id":"1426015393825","submission_author":{"email_address":"","name":"Colleen Forshee","legal_name":"Colleen Forshee","gender":"female","mailing_address":"Not provided on original meditation","phone_number":"","bio":"n/a","honorific":"Ms."}}
