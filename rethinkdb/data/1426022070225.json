I learned to preserve corn, beans, tomatoes, and other garden vegetables and luscious fruits. This was a lot to learn-and a lot of work! But I kept at it. Later, the good food I had stored up provided our winter meals, and we enjoyed pickles and fruit jams all year long.\r\nIn the same way, if we store up some of the bounty of God's word in our hearts, we can draw sustenance from that supply of encouragement  and guidance when lean times come. In prosperous seasons, recalling a challenging Bible verse can jolt  us out of spiritual complacency, like a tart bite of pickle. At any time, a scriptural reminder of the Lord's love tastes sweet as strawberry jam!\r\nMemorizing may be hard work for you, as it is for me. But I intend to keep at it, to transform my heart into a storehouse of God's word. How about you?\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"What do you store up in your heart?\r\n","prayer":"Lord, help me choose and learn the verses you know I'll need someday.
