When he did, God dealt with him kindly and gently and with great care. He surprised him with an angel and his still small voice.\r\n\r\nOur loving, heavenly Father's surprises never end. How amazing to realize that he has prepared surprises for us, his children, that are just what we need, just when we need them.\r\n\r\nIn my life there have been times when I have been surprised by the warmth and peace of God's Holy Spirit filling me and reassuring me that he is with me and he is all I need. A reminder that 'the joy of the Lord is my strength' (Neh. 8:10) comes when I am surprised by the laughter of kookaburras visiting my garden. The beauty of the stars in the sky on a clear, dark night surprises me with the knowledge of God's creativity and magnitude. The unexpected gift of a meal from my church family surprises me with the reminder that God knows my every need. God's care for me and the way he lovingly deals with me and encourages me never ceases to surprise me.\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"God's surprises never end.","prayer":"Heavenly Father, thank you for caring for us with such tenderness.
