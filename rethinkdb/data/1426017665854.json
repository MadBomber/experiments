As a volunteer tutor at a community center, I had been assigned to help Tony with his math homework.  For more than an hour, I had shown Tony ways to solve math problems, but he clearly was not interested in my tips.  In fact, during most of the tutoring session, he had grumbled and complained, explaining that he did not see any value in learning math. After listening to his complaints, I began to tell him why I thought math was important.  After several minutes, Tony looked at his math problems, apologized for his behavior, and said that he was ready to work on his assignment.\r\n\r\nIt does not take much to start complaining. Just as the Israelites did in today's Scripture, we, too, might find ourselves grumbling and expressing our doubts toward God. Often, these doubts come as a result of not understanding what God is doing in our lives. But God knows what is best for us, and he has a unique plan for each of us. If we obey God and rest securely in his promises, he will open our hearts and minds and allow us to see his purpose.\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"In times of doubt and fear, draw near to God.","prayer":"Lord, we often fear what we do not understand.
