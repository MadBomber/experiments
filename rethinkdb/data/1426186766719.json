Then she beamed and said, \"Do it again.\" No matter how many times I tossed my child in the air, she begged me to do it again. Eventually I had to fulfill other responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis experience helps me understand why Jesus told his disciples, \"Let's go somewhere else.\" After Jesus healed a large crowd the previous evening, the next day more people searched for him to do it again. Through prayer, his Father led him to continue his mission in other parts of Galilee. God's timing was for Jesus to go preach and heal in the nearby villages.\r\n\r\nLike Jesus, you and I face an endless stream of pleas for help. We cannot give our time and money to every worthy cause that clamors for our attention. But we can ask God for wisdom. Prayer helps us discern not only which needs to meet, but also when and how long we should tend to those tasks. The Holy Spirit will show us when to do it again and when to move on.\r\n","thought_for_the_day":"Today I will ask God to reveal his agenda.\r\n","prayer":"Dear Lord, direct us to listen each day so we may know your will and timing.
