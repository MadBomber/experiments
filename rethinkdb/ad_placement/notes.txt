RethinkDB Setup on OSX

RethinkDB Setup on OSX

This guide will get RethinkDB setup and running with a default configuration on OSX. There is also an option for setting RethinkDB to start at boot time on OSX, and a note on upgrading to a more recent RethinkDB version.
First Installation

Install Homebrew if you don't already have it:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Install RethinkDB:

brew update
brew install rethinkdb

Now modify either ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.bashrc to add the following shortcuts to start/stop RethinkDB:

alias rethinkdb.start='launchctl load /usr/local/opt/rethinkdb/homebrew.mxcl.rethinkdb.plist'
alias rethinkdb.stop='launchctl unload /usr/local/opt/rethinkdb/homebrew.mxcl.rethinkdb.plist'

Run source ~/.bash_aliases or source ~/.bashrc to update the shell environment.

Run rethinkdb.start and then visit http://localhost:8080/
Python Development Tools

Install the python driver to access RethinkDB:

sudo pip install rethinkdb

Starting RethinkDB with OSX

If you'd prefer RethinkDB to be always available, run this command:

ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/rethinkdb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Upgrading RethinkDB

brew update
brew upgrade rethinkdb
sudo pip install -U rethinkdb
