MissileWare, as mentioned in your inquiry, does not appear directly in the provided code. However, based on the context, it seems like you're asking about the Middleware components (`Logging` and `Instrumentation`) within the `SimpleFlow` module.

Both `Logging` and `Instrumentation` middleware are designed to wrap around callable objects (such as steps in a `Pipeline`), performing their respective tasks "around" the step's execution. In other words, they are executed around a call to a step, not just between steps or at a stopping point:

- For the `Logging` middleware, it logs a message before and after the execution of the step it wraps. This means it executes around the step—first logging "Before call", then executing the step, and finally logging "After call".
  
  ```ruby
  def call(result)
    logger.info("Before call")
    result = @callable.call(result)
    logger.info("After call")
    result
  end
  ```

- Similarly, the `Instrumentation` middleware measures the execution time of the step it wraps. It does so by marking the time before the step's execution and calculating the duration right after the execution finishes, effectively wrapping the step's execution to add instrumentation.

  ```ruby
  def call(result)
    start_time = Time.now
    result = @callable.call(result)
    duration = Time.now - start_time
    puts "Instrumentation: #{@api_key} took #{duration}s"
    result
  end
  ```

These middleware components are applied to steps within the `Pipeline` class through the `apply_middleware` method, effectively wrapping the steps in the middleware's functionality. This allows for a flexible system where middleware can modify or monitor step executions non-intrusively, supporting concerns like logging, performance measurement, authorization, or other cross-cutting concerns without changing the steps' implementation.

To summarize, based on your provided code, the concept of "MissleWare" (interpreted as middleware action) is executed around a step's call—both before and after the step's logic runs—rather than just between steps or at stopping points in the flow.
