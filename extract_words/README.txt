# extract_words/READNE.txt

It seems like every time I do an OCR on a thing to extract
actionable text I always end up with "words" that are crammed
together because the OCR process did not recognize the blank
between the words.  The spelling checker will catch these
problems but the checker is not "smart" enought to know that
the one mis-spelled word is really multiple correctly spelled
words.

Take for example the string 'tellthetruthmister' where our
naturally intelligent minds recognize quickly that it should
be "tell the truth mister" but the spelling checker just
throws up its hands.
