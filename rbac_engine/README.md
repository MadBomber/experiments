# RbacEngine

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Don't know if it should be a rails engine or a simple Gem for use on non-Rails
projects.

Its going to be a Gem.  Not sure as to what its name will be.  Not sure but it
might even end up as a plugin for CanCanCan.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rbac_engine'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rbac_engine

## Usage
