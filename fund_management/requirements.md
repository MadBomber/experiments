## 1. Saturn Fund

The “Saturn Fund” is raising $100 million to invest in a private equity rollup strategy. They will invest in 10 deals at $10 million of equity each and raise $1 million from 100 investors. The fund will have a 10-year life. Projected returns are:

- **15%/year** - Base case
- **9%/year** - Bear case
- **21%/year** - Bull case

The discount (or risk free) rate is **10%/year**.

### a. Total Fund Profits

1. In the base case, what are the total fund profits in real and nominal dollars?

   **Hint:** Total gross profits = nominal, total gross profits - risk-free profits = real.

### b. MOIC Calculation

What is the bear, bull, and base MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) per investor?

### c. Waterfall Distribution

Assume that at the end of the fund’s lifetime it gets acquired by an even bigger private equity firm for $500 million. Build a waterfall distribution with the following structure (please look up “Private Equity Waterfall” if unfamiliar terminology):

1. **1.8x MOIC hurdle** to investors
2. After **1.8x MOIC** to investors, **20% share to the General Partner (GP)** up to a **2.7x MOIC** to investors (or “LPs”).
   - Please note that a Limited Partner (LP) is an investor while the GP is the operator that runs the fund strategy.
   - The GPs collect performance and sometimes management fees.
   - This question is only asking you to calculate performance fees.
3. After a **2.7x MOIC** is returned to investors, a **30% profit share to the GP**.
