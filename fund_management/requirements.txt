Easefolio Second Round Brain Teaser
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY, PLEASE COMPLETE AND RETURN WITHIN 168 HOURS

1.​ The “Saturn Fund” is raising $100m to invest in a private equity rollup strategy. They
will invest in 10 deals at $10m of equity each and raise $1m from 100 investors. The fund
will have a 10 year life. Projected returns are 15%/year base case, 9%/year bear case, and
21%/year bull case. The discount (or risk free) rate is 10%/year.
a.​ In the base case, what are the total fund profits in real and nominal dollars?
i.​ Hint, total gross profits=nominal, total gross profits-risk free profits=real
b.​ What is the bear, bull, and base MOIC (multiple on invested capital) per investor?
c.​ Assume that at the end of the fund’s lifetime it gets acquired by an even bigger
private equity firm for $500m. Build a waterfall distribution with the following
structure (please look up “Private Equity Waterfall” if unfamiliar terminology)
i.​ 1.8x MOIC hurdle to investors
ii.​ After 1.8x MOIC to investors, 20% share to the General Partner (GP) up
to a 2.7x MOIC to investors (or “LPs”).
●​ Please note that a Limited Partner (LP) is an investor while the
GP is the operator that runs the fund strategy.
●​ The GPs collect performance and sometimes management fees.
●​ This question is only asking you to calculate performance fees.
iii.​ After a 2.7x MOIC is returned to investors, a 30% profit share to the GP.
2.​ The “Venus Fund” is an open end fund (also called an “evergreen fund”) which focuses
on trading cryptocurrencies and stocks. Their target annual returns are 27%/year before
any fees. The fund has an annual hurdle rate for investors (see “Private Equity Waterfall”
research suggestion and point 1.b.i. above) of 10%. The GP profit share is 20% over the
10% hurdle and 30% if a 27% return to investors is achieved. Please model the following
a.​ 3 investors join in 2017 for $100k each.
b.​ The fund purchased $250k of BTC in January of 2018.
c.​ 2 new investors join for $100k each in 2019.
d.​ The fund purchases $150k of ETH shortly after.
e.​ The fund also purchases $100k of Tesla in 2019.
f.​ In 2020, the first investor pulls out his entire account and the second investor
pulls out 50% of their money. The other investors remain in the fund.
g.​ Please clarify the assumed price of each asset you purchase and back up your
math. Make sure to include the necessary waterfall calculations.
h.​ Fund calculations beyond EOY 2021 (“Projections”) are not required.
