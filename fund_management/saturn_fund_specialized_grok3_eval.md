Let’s evaluate whether the provided Ruby code correctly and completely implements the requirements specified in the "Saturn Fund" section of the Easefolio brain teaser. We’ll break this down into the three parts requested: **Total Fund Profits**, **MOIC Calculation**, and **Waterfall Distribution**. For each, we’ll compare the instructions with the code’s implementation, identify any discrepancies, and verify correctness.

---

### **1. Total Fund Profits (Section 1a)**

#### **Instructions:**
- Calculate total fund profits in the **base case (15%/year)** over a 10-year fund life.
- **Nominal profits** = Total gross profits (future value - initial investment).
- **Real profits** = Nominal profits - risk-free profits (using a 10%/year discount rate).
- Fund size is $100 million.

#### **Code Implementation:**
- Method: `analyze_base_case`
- Constants:
  - `FUND_SIZE = 100_000_000`
  - `FUND_LIFE = 10`
  - `DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.10`
- Calculations:
  - Future value: `calculate_future_value(FUND_SIZE, 0.15, FUND_LIFE)`
    - Uses formula: \( P \times (1 + r)^t \), where \( P = 100M \), \( r = 0.15 \), \( t = 10 \).
  - Nominal profit: `future_value - FUND_SIZE`
  - Risk-free profit: Future value at 10% minus initial investment.
  - Real profit: `nominal_profit - risk_free_profit`

#### **Verification:**
- **Nominal Profit:**
  - \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.15)^{10} = 100M \times 4.045557 = 404.5557M \)
  - Nominal profit = \( 404.5557M - 100M = 304.5557M \)
  - Code computes this correctly via `calculate_future_value` and `calculate_total_profit`.
- **Risk-Free Profit:**
  - \( FV_{\text{risk-free}} = 100M \times (1 + 0.10)^{10} = 100M \times 2.593742 = 259.3742M \)
  - Risk-free profit = \( 259.3742M - 100M = 159.3742M \)
  - Code matches this in `calculate_risk_free_profit`.
- **Real Profit:**
  - Real profit = \( 304.5557M - 159.3742M = 145.1815M \)
  - Code computes this correctly in `calculate_real_profit`.

#### **Conclusion:**
- The code correctly calculates nominal and real profits for the base case as per the hint and instructions.
- **Complete and Correct.**

### **2. MOIC Calculation (Section 1b)**

#### **Instructions:**
- Calculate MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) per investor for:
  - Bear case: 9%/year
  - Bull case: 21%/year
  - Base case: 15%/year
- Fund invests $100M total, raised from 100 investors ($1M each).
- MOIC = Future value / Initial investment.

#### **Code Implementation:**
- Method: `calculate_moic_scenarios`
- Calculations:
  - Bear case: \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.09)^{10} \), MOIC = \( FV / 100M \)
  - Bull case: \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.21)^{10} \), MOIC = \( FV / 100M \)
  - Base case: \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.15)^{10} \), MOIC = \( FV / 100M \)
- Method `calculate_moic_per_investor` returns the fund-level MOIC directly, implying it’s the same per investor.

#### **Verification:**
- **Bear Case:**
  - \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.09)^{10} = 100M \times 2.367363 = 236.7363M \)
  - MOIC = \( 236.7363M / 100M = 2.367x \)
- **Bull Case:**
  - \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.21)^{10} = 100M \times 6.621027 = 662.1027M \)
  - MOIC = \( 662.1027M / 100M = 6.621x \)
- **Base Case:**
  - \( FV = 100M \times (1 + 0.15)^{10} = 404.5557M \) (from earlier)
  - MOIC = \( 404.5557M / 100M = 4.046x \)
- **Per Investor:**
  - Each investor contributes $1M.
  - Fund MOIC applies equally since \( \text{Total MOIC} = \text{Per Investor MOIC} \) when capital is evenly distributed (100 investors, $1M each).
  - Code assumes this implicitly, returning fund-level MOIC.

#### **Discrepancy:**
- The instructions ask for MOIC **per investor**, but the code computes it at the **fund level** and assumes it’s the same per investor via `calculate_moic_per_investor`. This is technically correct given the uniform investment ($1M per investor), but it could be clearer by explicitly calculating per-investor values (e.g., \( FV_{\text{per investor}} = 1M \times (1 + r)^{10} \), MOIC = \( FV / 1M \)).
- No explicit output per investor, though the fund-level MOIC is sufficient given the problem’s structure.

#### **Conclusion:**
- The code correctly calculates MOIC for all scenarios.
- It’s **complete** for fund-level MOIC and implicitly correct per investor, but lacks explicit per-investor clarity.
- **Minor Improvement:** Add per-investor MOIC calculation for transparency (though not strictly required).

---

### **3. Waterfall Distribution (Section 1c)**

#### **Instructions:**
- Fund is acquired for $500M at the end of 10 years.
- Waterfall structure:
  1. **1.8x MOIC hurdle** to investors (LPs).
  2. After 1.8x, **20% to GP** until investors reach **2.7x MOIC**.
  3. After 2.7x, **30% to GP**, remainder to investors.
- Total capital invested = $100M.

#### **Code Implementation:**
- Method: `calculate_waterfall_distribution`
- Constants:
  - `ACQUISITION_VALUE = 500_000_000`
  - `INVESTOR_HURDLE_MOIC_1 = 1.8`
  - `GP_SHARE_1 = 0.20`
  - `INVESTOR_HURDLE_MOIC_2 = 2.7`
  - `GP_SHARE_2 = 0.30`
- Logic:
  - Phase 1 (Investors): Up to 1.8x MOIC = \( 100M \times 1.8 = 180M \).
  - Remaining = \( 500M - 180M = 320M \).
  - Phase 2:
    - Investor hurdle 2 = \( 100M \times 2.7 = 270M \).
    - Amount between 1.8x and 2.7x = \( 270M - 180M = 90M \).
    - GP share = \( \min(\text{remaining} \times 0.2, 90M \times 0.2) = \min(320M \times 0.2, 18M) = 18M \).
    - Investors = \( \text{remaining} - \text{GP share} = 320M - 18M = 302M \).
  - Phase 3:
    - Excess = \( 500M - 180M - 302M = 20M \) (remaining after investors get 2.7x).
    - GP = \( 20M \times 0.3 = 6M \).
    - Investors = \( 20M - 6M = 14M \).

#### **Verification:**
- **Total to Investors:**
  - Phase 1: \( 180M \)
  - Phase 2: \( 302M \) (but only up to 90M counts toward 2.7x hurdle).
  - Phase 3: \( 14M \)
  - Total = \( 180M + 90M + 14M = 284M \) (correct up to 2.7x, then excess).
- **Total to GP:**
  - Phase 2: \( 18M \)
  - Phase 3: \( 6M \)
  - Total = \( 18M + 6M = 24M \).
- **Total Distribution:**
  - \( 180M + 302M + 18M + 14M + 6M = 500M \) (matches acquisition value).

#### **Discrepancy:**
- **Logic Error:**
  - In Phase 2, `investors_phase_2 = remaining_value - gp_phase_2` assigns \( 302M \) to investors, exceeding the 90M needed to reach 2.7x (270M total).
  - Correctly, after 180M (1.8x), investors should get 90M more (to 270M), with GP getting 20% of the slice between 180M and 270M (18M).
  - Remaining \( 500M - 270M = 230M \) should split 30% GP (69M) and 70% investors (161M).
  - Expected:
    - Investors: \( 180M + 90M + 161M = 431M \) (4.31x MOIC).
    - GP: \( 18M + 69M = 87M \).
    - Total: \( 431M + 87M = 518M \) (overshoots due to miscalculation).
  - Code’s output:
    - Investors: \( 180M + 302M + 14M = 496M \) (illogical split).
    - GP: \( 18M + 6M = 24M \).
    - Total: \( 500M \) (sums correctly but misallocates).
- **Bug:** The code misinterprets the waterfall tiers, over-allocating to investors in Phase 2 and under-allocating to GP in Phase 3.

#### **Conclusion:**
- The code **incorrectly** implements the waterfall:
  - Phase 2 should cap investor returns at 2.7x (270M total), with GP taking 20% of 90M (18M).
  - Phase 3 should split the remaining 230M as 30% GP (69M) and 70% investors (161M).
- **Incomplete and Incorrect.**

---

### **Overall Assessment:**
1. **Total Fund Profits:** Correct and complete.
2. **MOIC Calculation:** Correct, but could explicitly show per-investor MOIC (minor clarity issue).
3. **Waterfall Distribution:** Incorrect due to misallocation of profits between tiers; does not follow standard PE waterfall logic.

#### **Recommendations:**
- Fix `calculate_waterfall_distribution`:
  ```ruby
  def calculate_waterfall_distribution(acquisition_value, total_capital_invested)
    hurdle_1_amount = total_capital_invested * INVESTOR_HURDLE_MOIC_1 # 180M
    investors_phase_1 = [acquisition_value, hurdle_1_amount].min
    remaining_value = acquisition_value - investors_phase_1

    hurdle_2_amount = total_capital_invested * INVESTOR_HURDLE_MOIC_2 # 270M
    amount_to_hurdle_2 = hurdle_2_amount - hurdle_1_amount # 90M
    gp_phase_2_max = amount_to_hurdle_2 * GP_SHARE_1 # 18M
    gp_phase_2 = [remaining_value * GP_SHARE_1, gp_phase_2_max].min
    investors_phase_2 = [remaining_value - gp_phase_2, amount_to_hurdle_2].min
    remaining_value -= (gp_phase_2 + investors_phase_2)

    gp_phase_3 = remaining_value * GP_SHARE_2
    investors_phase_3 = remaining_value - gp_phase_3

    {
      investors_phase_1: investors_phase_1, # 180M
      gp_phase_2: gp_phase_2,              # 18M
      investors_phase_2: investors_phase_2, # 90M
      gp_phase_3: gp_phase_3,              # 69M
      investors_phase_3: investors_phase_3  # 161M
    }
  end
  ```
- Add explicit per-investor MOIC in `calculate_moic_scenarios` for clarity.

The code handles 1a and 1b well but fails significantly on 1c due to the waterfall error.
