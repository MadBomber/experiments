Okay, let's break down the Venus Fund scenario step-by-step, with detailed explanations and Ruby code for the calculations.

Understanding the Financial Terms

Before diving into the code, let's clarify the key financial terms involved:

Open-End Fund (Evergreen Fund): A type of investment fund that doesn't have a fixed number of shares. It can issue new shares to new investors and redeem shares from investors who want to withdraw their money. Think of it like a company that can always sell more stock or buy stock back from its shareholders.

Target Annual Returns: The annual percentage return the fund aims to achieve before any fees are deducted. This is the goal they are striving for.

Hurdle Rate: A minimum annual return that investors must receive before the fund's General Partner (GP) or manager can take a performance-based fee (also known as carried interest). It's like a benchmark. If the fund doesn't beat the hurdle rate, the GP doesn't get the performance fee.

GP Profit Share (Carried Interest): A share of the profits earned by the fund that is paid to the fund's General Partner or manager. It's an incentive for the GP to perform well. It's typically structured as a percentage of profits above the hurdle rate. In our case, it's tiered: 20% above 10% and 30% above 27%.

Waterfall Calculation: A series of distributions of profits that are allocated in a specific order, often to pay back initial investments first, then to meet the hurdle rate, and finally to the GP. It outlines how the profits are split.

Asset: Something the fund owns that has value, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tesla stock.

Withdrawal: When an investor takes money out of the fund.

Explanation and Analysis

Data Structures: We use Struct to create data structures for FundState (holding fund information for a given year) and Investor (holding individual investor details). This helps organize the data clearly.

Helper Methods: We define methods like calculate_annual_return, calculate_btc_holdings_value, handle_asset_purchase, handle_new_investors, and handle_withdrawals to encapsulate the logic for specific actions. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Event Handling:

handle_asset_purchase: This method simulates the purchase of assets. It calculates the number of coins/shares purchased based on the amount invested and the assumed price. It updates the fund's holdings and total AUM (Assets Under Management).

handle_new_investors: This method simulates new investors joining the fund. It increases the total AUM and adds the investors to the investor list.

handle_withdrawals: This method handles investor withdrawals, adjusting the AUM and updating the investor's current investment.

calculate_fund_performance: Calculates the end of year values, factoring in total asset value and annual return.

Assumptions and Asset Pricing (Section g): In a real-world scenario, you'd replace BTC_PRICE_2018, ETH_PRICE_2019, TSLA_PRICE_2019, and other prices with actual historical market data. I've provided example prices to make the code runnable. The key is that you need to specify the price at the time of purchase to calculate how many units of each asset the fund acquired. The line btc_purchased = amount / asset_price inside handle_asset_purchase shows how the number of BTC acquired is calculated. The same logic applies to ETH and Tesla.

Waterfall Calculation: The calculate_profit_share is where the waterfall calculation happens. It first calculates profit up to the hurdle rate. Then, it applies the appropriate GP share based on whether the fund exceeded the target return. This structure ensures that investors receive their minimum return before the GP receives a larger share. This function also ensures that the GP share does not exceed the profit available for that level.

Step-by-Step Simulation: The code then simulates the events chronologically, updating the fund state with each event and storing the state in the fund_states array. This allows you to track the fund's performance over time.

Running the Code and Interpreting the Output

When you run the Ruby code, it will print a series of messages showing the actions that occurred (asset purchases, new investors, withdrawals) and the resulting fund state for each year. It will show:

Purchases of BTC, ETH and Tesla

New investor investment amounts

Withdrawal amounts from investors

Yearly AUM, asset values and annual return

Important Considerations:

Real-World Complexity: This is a simplified model. Real-world fund management involves many more factors, including:

Transaction costs (brokerage fees, exchange fees)

Management fees (annual fees charged by the GP regardless of performance)

Taxes

More complex waterfall structures

Rebalancing strategies (adjusting asset allocation)

Regulatory compliance

Data Accuracy: The accuracy of the model depends heavily on the accuracy of the asset price data you input.

Valuation: In a real fund, assets are valued regularly (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to determine the fund's net asset value (NAV).

This model provides a solid foundation for understanding the core concepts of fund management and how a waterfall calculation works. Remember to replace the example asset prices with actual data to get more meaningful results. Let me know if you have more questions.
