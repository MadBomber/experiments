Let’s dive into analyzing the Venus Fund scenario step by step. I’ll explain each financial term as we encounter it, assuming you’re new to these concepts, and provide detailed calculations using Ruby code with clear, verbose variable names and documentation. We’ll model the fund’s performance from 2017 to the end of 2021, covering investments, asset purchases, withdrawals, and profit-sharing waterfalls. Since specific asset price data isn’t provided, I’ll use reasonable historical approximations for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tesla stock, and I’ll document my assumptions.

### Key Financial Terms Explained

Before we start, here are the terms we’ll use:

- **Open-End Fund (Evergreen Fund):** This is a type of investment fund where investors can join or leave at any time, and the fund doesn’t have a fixed end date. Think of it like an ongoing party—people can come and go, and the party keeps running.
- **Target Annual Returns:** The fund aims to earn 27% per year on its investments before fees. This is the goal, like aiming to score 27 points in a game each year.
- **Hurdle Rate:** This is the minimum return the fund must achieve (10% per year) before the General Partner (GP) can take a share of the profits. It’s like a benchmark—if the fund doesn’t clear this bar, the GP doesn’t get a bonus.
- **GP Profit Share:** The General Partner (the fund managers) gets a percentage of profits above the hurdle rate. Here, it’s 20% of profits over 10%, and 30% if returns hit 27% or more. This is their reward for good performance.
- **Waterfall Calculations:** This refers to how profits are distributed in stages (or “tiers”). First, investors get their hurdle rate return; then, the GP takes their share of excess profits. It’s like slicing a cake—everyone gets a piece in a specific order.

### Assumptions for Asset Prices

Since the problem doesn’t provide exact prices, I’ll use approximate historical values based on the dates mentioned. These are simplified for clarity:

- **Bitcoin (BTC) in January 2018:** ~$13,000 per BTC. (BTC was volatile then, dropping from its late 2017 peak.)
- **Ethereum (ETH) in early 2019:** ~$150 per ETH. (ETH hovered around this after a 2018 decline.)
- **Tesla Stock in 2019:** ~$60 per share (pre-split price, adjusted for a 5-for-1 split in 2020; I’ll use pre-split values for simplicity.)
- **BTC by end of 2020:** ~$29,000 per BTC. (BTC surged in late 2020.)
- **ETH by end of 2020:** ~$730 per ETH. (ETH also rose significantly.)
- **Tesla by end of 2020:** ~$700 per share (pre-split equivalent, reflecting its 2020 boom.)

For 2021 projections, I’ll assume growth to EOY 2021:
- BTC: ~$47,000
- ETH: ~$3,800
- Tesla: ~$1,100

These are rough averages based on historical trends up to March 5, 2025 (my current date), but we’ll only calculate up to EOY 2021 as requested.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### a. Initial Investment (2017)
- **3 investors join with $100,000 each.**
- Total fund capital = $100,000 × 3 = $300,000.

#### b. Asset Purchase (January 2018)
- **Fund buys $250,000 of BTC.**
- Price: $13,000 per BTC.
- BTC purchased = $250,000 ÷ $13,000 = ~19.23 BTC.
- Remaining cash = $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.

#### c. Additional Investors (2019)
- **2 new investors join with $100,000 each.**
- New capital = $100,000 × 2 = $200,000.
- Total cash = $50,000 + $200,000 = $250,000.
- Total investor capital = $300,000 + $200,000 = $500,000.

#### d. Additional Asset Purchase (Early 2019)
- **Fund buys $150,000 of ETH.**
- Price: $150 per ETH.
- ETH purchased = $150,000 ÷ $150 = 1,000 ETH.
- Remaining cash = $250,000 - $150,000 = $100,000.

#### e. Further Asset Purchase (2019)
- **Fund buys $100,000 of Tesla.**
- Price: $60 per share.
- Shares purchased = $100,000 ÷ $60 = ~1,666.67 shares (rounded to 1,667).
- Remaining cash = $100,000 - $100,000 = $0.

#### f. Withdrawals (2020)
- **First investor withdraws 100% ($100,000 initial).**
- **Second investor withdraws 50% ($50,000 of their $100,000).**
- Total withdrawal = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.
- We’ll calculate their payouts based on the fund’s value in 2020.

#### g. Asset Pricing and Fund Value
Let’s calculate the fund’s value at key points and handle withdrawals.

##### End of 2020 Value
- **BTC:** 19.23 BTC × $29,000 = $557,670.
- **ETH:** 1,000 ETH × $730 = $730,000.
- **Tesla:** 1,667 shares × $700 = $1,166,900.
- **Total Value:** $557,670 + $730,000 + $1,166,900 = $2,454,570.
- **Initial Capital (before withdrawals):** $500,000.
- **Gain:** $2,454,570 - $500,000 = $1,954,570.

##### Withdrawals in 2020
- Fund value per dollar invested = $2,454,570 ÷ $500,000 = ~4.90914 ( NAV multiplier).
- Investor 1: $100,000 × 4.90914 = $490,914 withdrawn.
- Investor 2: $50,000 × 4.90914 = $245,457 withdrawn.
- Total withdrawn = $490,914 + $245,457 = $736,371.
- Remaining value = $2,454,570 - $736,371 = $1,718,199.
- Remaining capital base = $500,000 - $150,000 = $350,000.

##### End of 2021 Value
- **BTC:** 19.23 BTC × $47,000 = $903,810.
- **ETH:** 1,000 ETH × $3,800 = $3,800,000.
- **Tesla:** 1,667 shares × $1,100 = $1,833,700.
- **Total Value:** $903,810 + $3,800,000 + $1,833,700 = $6,537,510.
- **Remaining Capital:** $350,000.

### Waterfall Calculations (2021)

Now, let’s apply the hurdle rate and GP profit share for 2021, based on returns from 2017/2019 to EOY 2021.

- **Total Gain (2020-2021):** $6,537,510 - $1,718,199 = $4,819,311 over $350,000.
- **Annualized Return:** This is complex with varying investment dates, so let’s simplify to 2021 performance:
  - Return for 2021 = ($6,537,510 - $1,718,199) ÷ $1,718,199 = ~2.805 (280.5% for the year).
- **Hurdle Rate (10%):** $1,718,199 × 0.10 = $171,819.90.
- **Value after Hurdle:** $6,537,510 - $1,718,199 - $171,819.90 = $4,647,491.10 excess profit.
- **Target Return (27%):** $1,718,199 × 0.27 = $463,913.73.
- Since 280.5% > 27%, use the 30% GP share on excess above 10%.

#### Waterfall Tiers
1. **Investor Hurdle (10%):** $171,819.90 to investors.
2. **Excess Profit:** $4,647,491.10.
3. **GP Share (30%):** $4,647,491.10 × 0.30 = $1,394,247.33.
4. **Investors’ Share (70%):** $4,647,491.10 × 0.70 = $3,253,243.77.

- **Total to Investors:** $1,718,199 + $171,819.90 + $3,253,243.77 = $5,143,262.67.
- **GP Profit:** $1,394,247.33.
