To break down this analysis of the Venus Fund as requested, we need to clarify some financial terms and outline the calculations step-by-step. 

### Financial Terms Explained:

1. **Open-end Fund / Evergreen Fund**: This refers to a type of mutual fund that can issue an unlimited number of shares and is continuously offered to investors. Investors can buy or sell shares at any time based on the net asset value (NAV) of those shares.

2. **Target Annual Returns**: This is the expected return on investment per year, which in this case is 27% before fees. It indicates the fund manager's goal for generating profit.

3. **Hurdle Rate**: The minimum rate of return that a fund must achieve before the fund managers can start to take a share of the profits. Here, it’s set at 10%.

4. **GP Profit Share**: GP stands for General Partner, and typically refers to the fund manager. The profit share describes how much of the profits they take after meeting the hurdle rate, which is structured as a percentage of profits exceeding the hurdle rate.

5. **Withdrawal**: This refers to when an investor takes their money back from the fund. This can significantly impact the remaining investors’ share of the fund.

6. **Waterfall Calculations**: This method is used to outline how profits are distributed among investors and fund managers through various stages or "waterfalls."

### Overview of Investment Scenario:

1. **Initial Investment**:
   - In 2017, 3 investors put in **$100,000** each.
   - Total Initial Investment = \(3 \times 100,000 = 300,000\)

2. **Purchasing Assets**:
   - January 2018, the fund purchases **$250,000** of Bitcoin (BTC).  
   - This would anchor the fund’s initial assets.

3. **Additional Investors**:
   - In 2019, 2 new investors join at **$100,000** each.
   - Total Additional Investment = \(2 \times 100,000 = 200,000\)

4. **Further Asset Purchases**:
   - After the new investors join, the fund buys **$150,000** of Ethereum (ETH).
   - Then, it purchases **$100,000** of Tesla (TSLA).

5. **Withdrawals**:
   - In 2020, the first investor withdraws their entire investment of **$100,000**.
   - The second investor withdraws **50%** of their investment, which is \(0.50 \times 100,000 = 50,000\).

6. **Asset Pricing and Projections**:
   - We will need to assume prices for BTC, ETH, and TSLA at the respective purchase times, calculate profits and managers' fees. The calculations will also indicate how much remains available to other investors after withdrawals.

### Ruby Code to Execute Calculations

Here's a Ruby script to exemplify the calculations based on the provided investments and withdrawals:

```ruby
# This class will handle the calculations for Venus Fund.
class VenusFund
  attr_reader :investors, :total_investment, :initial_assets, :profit, :withdrawals

  def initialize
    @investors = 0
    @total_investment = 0
    @initial_assets = 0
    @profit = 0
    @withdrawals = []
  end

  # Method to add initial investors
  def add_investors(num_investors, investment_each)
    @investors += num_investors
    @total_investment += num_investors * investment_each
  end

  # Method to purchase assets
  def purchase_assets(amount)
    @initial_assets += amount
  end

  # Method to simulate investment growth over time
  def simulate_growth(years, annual_return_target)
    @profit = @total_investment * (1 + annual_return_target) ** years - @total_investment
    @initial_assets += @profit
  end

  # Method to process withdrawal
  def withdraw(investor_id, amount)
    if amount <= @total_investment
      @withdrawals << { investor_id: investor_id, amount: amount }
      @total_investment -= amount
    else
      puts "Withdrawal amount exceeds available investment!"
    end
  end

  # Method to calculate manager's fees
  def calculate_manager_fee
    if @profit > (0.1 * @total_investment)
      excess_profit = @profit - (0.1 * @total_investment)
      if excess_profit > (0.27 * @total_investment - 0.1 * @total_investment)
        fee = 0.3 * excess_profit
      else
        fee = 0.2 * excess_profit
      end
    end
    fee || 0
  end
end

# Initialize the Venus Fund
venus_fund = VenusFund.new

# Add initial investors (2017)
venus_fund.add_investors(3, 100000)

# Purchase BTC (2018)
venus_fund.purchase_assets(250000)

# Add additional investors (2019)
venus_fund.add_investors(2, 100000)

# Purchase ETH (2019)
venus_fund.purchase_assets(150000)

# Purchase TSLA (2019)
venus_fund.purchase_assets(100000)

# Simulate growth for 2 years at 27%: from 2018 to end of 2020
venus_fund.simulate_growth(2, 0.27)

# Withdrawals (Year 2020)
venus_fund.withdraw(1, 100000) # First investor withdraws
venus_fund.withdraw(2, 50000)   # Second investor withdraws 50%

# Calculate manager's fee
manager_fee = venus_fund.calculate_manager_fee

# Output the current state of the fund
puts "Total Investment after withdrawals: #{venus_fund.total_investment}"
puts "Total Assets managed by fund: #{venus_fund.initial_assets}"
puts "Total Manager's Fee: #{manager_fee}"

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **VenusFund Class**: This class encapsulates all the necessary computations and tracks investments, withdrawals, and assets.
- **add_investors Method**: Adjusts the number of investors and total investments based on how much they are contributing.
- **purchase_assets Method**: Keeps track of the total assets purchased.
- **simulate_growth Method**: Calculates the growth of investments using exponential growth based on a target return for the given number of years.
- **withdraw Method**: Handles withdrawals by checking if the requested amount is less than what is available.
- **calculate_manager_fee Method**: Determines the profit share for fund managers based on profits exceeding the hurdle rate.

### Result:
After running the Ruby script, you'll get the current state of the fund, total investments after withdrawals, total assets managed, and the manager's fee. 

**Note**: The calculations depend on various assumptions including the initial asset prices and factor in compounding returns which will affect the final asset value. You can refine these calculations by including actual price data at specific points in time for a more accurate financial analysis.

This comprehensive approach helps investors understand the growth of their investment, the impact of withdrawals, and how fees are structured within the fund, enhancing their decision-making when considering fund investment.
