Implement async support for CityCouncil with health status subscription

This update introduces asynchronous capabilities for the CityCouncil module, 
enabling it to handle CLI interactions and departmental health status 
responses more efficiently. By leveraging the Async context, the CityCouncil 
now starts its governance process in parallel, providing a more responsive 
experience when handling service requests.

Additionally, health status messages are now subscribed to, allowing the 
CityCouncil to react dynamically to updates from departments, enhancing 
communication and oversight.

Referencing microservice interactions, this change aims to improve 
system performance and interactivity while ensuring robust 
departmental health monitoring.
