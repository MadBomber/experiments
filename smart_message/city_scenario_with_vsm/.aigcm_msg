Add Department of Government Efficiency Analysis Script

Introduced a new Ruby script to analyze the efficiency of government
departments by identifying similarities between them. The script loads
department configurations from YAML files, extracts keywords, and
computes similarity scores based on capabilities and keywords. If
departments exceed a specified similarity threshold, potential
combinations are suggested for review. This tool is intended to help
streamline departments by identifying overlap and opportunities for
collaboration.
