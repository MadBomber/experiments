Add status line prefix to citizen, house, and visitor classes

This commit introduces a new attribute, `@status_line_prefix`, to the 
Citizen, House, and Visitor classes to enhance status messaging. The 
prefix is derived from the citizen's name, house address, and 
visitor's home town, respectively. This change improves clarity in 
messaging outputs by providing relevant contextual information for 
each class instance and will aid in debugging and logging processes.
