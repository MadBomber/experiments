# NOTE: This file will be overwritten when "justprep" ie excuted

# By default the "just" CLI utility looks for a file named "justfile"
# in its current directory hiearchie.  Using "justprep" as a pre-processor
# (in an alias wrapper for example) the file "main.just" will be used
# to build a new "justfile" by incorporating various user defined modules.


alias cr  := compile
alias ins := install

# Compile the crystal version of justprep
compile:
  crystal build --no-debug --release -p -o bin/justprep justprep.cr


# Install the justprep executable in ~/bin
install: compile
  cp bin/justprep ~/bin
