To establish a connection with a database for the first time using active_record and sqlite3 in Ruby when no database file currently exists, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required gems:
```ruby
gem install activerecord sqlite3
```

2. Create a Ruby file, let's say `database_setup.rb`, and require the necessary libraries:
```ruby
require 'active_record'
require 'sqlite3'
```

3. Establish a connection to the SQLite database by configuring the active_record with the appropriate settings. For example:
```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  adapter: 'sqlite3',
  database: '/path/to/database.db'
)
```
Replace `/path/to/database.db` with the path where you want to create your SQLite database file. Make sure to provide a valid file path.

4. Define your models as subclasses of `ActiveRecord::Base`. For instance, you can create a `User` model:
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```
You can add any required associations, validations, or methods to the model as per your application's needs.

5. Optionally, you can create the necessary database tables corresponding to your models by running the following command:
```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
  create_table :users do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.integer :age
    # add more columns here if needed
    t.timestamps
  end
end
```
This example creates a `users` table with `name`, `age`, and timestamp columns. Adjust the table name and columns according to your requirements.

Make sure you run the above command only once to create the tables. If running multiple times, it can result in errors.

6. You have now established a connection to the SQLite database and can start using active_record for querying and manipulating data. For example, you can create a new user:
```ruby
User.create(name: 'John Doe', age: 25)
```

Remember to require and run this `database_setup.rb` file whenever you need to establish a connection with the database.

Make sure to adjust the file paths, table/column names, and models to fit your specific application needs.
