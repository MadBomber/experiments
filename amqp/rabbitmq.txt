To have launchd start rabbitmq at login:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load rabbitmq now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    rabbitmq-server
