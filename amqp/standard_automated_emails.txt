## Meditation Not Chosen for Publication:


DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE


Thank you for your willingness to share your faith through your writing.  Even though this meditation was not chosen for publication, we want you to know that we appreciate the time and effort you put into preparing and submitting your work.  Without people like you who are willing to share your faith, there could be no magazine.

Note: Due to the limited size of our staff, we cannot provide individual critiques/comments for meditations.  However, you can find helpful information for writers on our website.  Go to:

http://devotional.upperroom.org/resources/writers-info


Please continue to submit your writing through our website at:

http://www.upperroom.org/devotional/submit.asp

Or to the following address:

UReditorial@gbod.org


Thanks again for your support.  We look forward to seeing more of your work.

 
Grace and peace,

The Upper Room staff

## Meditation Held for Further Consideration:

DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE


We would like to hold your meditation based on [Quoted Scripture Verse] for further consideration.

 If you sent more than one meditation, only the one identified above is being considered.

It may be as long as a year before a final decision is made about your work (even longer if the subject is seasonal).  If your work is chosen for publication, we will send you a letter and forms to complete and return to us.  Receiving these forms will be the indication that your work is definitely being published.  Please keep us up to date regarding any change to your postal and email addresses.  Also, please continue to submit any future submissions to the following address:

UReditorial@gbod.org

Or through our website at:

http://www.upperroom.org/devotional/submit.asp

Thank you for sending us your writing and for your willingness to share your faith with our readers around the world.  Without people like you, there could be no The Upper Room magazine.


Cordially,

The Upper Room staff
