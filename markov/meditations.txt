When I was a student at the Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico, I sowed some seeds on campus.  I chose one particular area where nothing grew, not even weeds, because there was never sufficient water or enough sunlight.  I was told I was wasting my time, but little by little, plant growth became visible.  Several years have gone by since I left.  But when I visit the seminary, I now see strong and healthy plants on campus.

This experience inspires me in my role as a pastor of a small church.  When the congregation is faced with challenges, I remember that God has not given up on the task of cultivating the seed of faith in me.  Rather, God encourages me to work harder on the small and the large projects entrusted to me.

Maybe it wasn’t I who chose the seemingly barren spot for my seminary garden; maybe it was God who chose it, in order to show me how, with patience and love, my ministry would bear fruit.

By God’s grace I continue serving God and God’s people.  God has much work for each of us to do and continues to call us to grow in our faith.


Four of us kids were throwing snowballs.  The moist snow made a hard projectile.  I packed one with my mittened hands and threw it with all my eight-year-old might.  It caught Ken flush in the face.  He grabbed his eye and in minutes was headed to the hospital.  A mix of shock and nausea weakened my knees as I watched silently.  No one had seen me, and I said nothing even though the injury caused weeks of vision problems for Ken.

After hearing sermons on forgiveness for 30 years, I realized that if forgiveness was a main theme of the Lord’s Prayer, then it meant a lot to God.  I started forgiving and asking forgiveness.

Ken, now about 50, topped my list.  Sweat poured off my hands as I dialed his number.  “Do you remember the snowball that hit you in the eye?” I stammered, confessing my guilt and asking for forgiveness.

He said, “Of course I forgive you.  You were just a kid.  You didn’t mean to hurt anybody.”  He assured me that the incident caused no lasting damage.

I closed my eyes and sighed, letting relief flow through me.  I thanked Ken, and I thanked God for the gift of forgiveness and for the grace in Ken’s heart.


While we were spring-cleaning our house one year, a small bird mistakenly flew inside the garage.  The trapped bird flew in circles and bumped into the walls while trying to find an escape route.

After several minutes of anxious struggle, the exhausted creature rested high atop a doorframe.  I grabbed a broom and extended the bristles up to where the bird was perched.  To my surprise, the bird hopped onto the bristles and hung on while I walked to the outdoors.  Immediately after exiting the garage, the bird flew to a nearby tree — free again!

Just like the bird, I sometimes find myself struggling intently with an issue or problem.  Worry creeps in as I try to find my way back out.  Before long, I am tired and exhausted.  In these instances, I can remember the words Paul wrote to the church at Philippi quoted above.  Instead of being anxious, I can lift my concerns up to God in prayer.  Not only does God have the answers but also the peace to set me free.


A good friend told me about a time when he was asked to sing at a church service.  As he looked out over the congregation, he started to feel inferior when he saw so many other people who had previously sung in worship.

However, after the service, a wonderful woman complimented him on his singing, saying it was “one of the best testimonies” she had ever heard.  He related to her his feelings of inadequacy as he compared himself to the other vocalists.

She responded that God is not as much concerned with our ability as with our availability.  God is pleased when we are willing to use what we have to serve regardless of how unskilled we think we are.

I am in a wheelchair due to a disability.  This was a good story for me as I struggle with these same feelings and compare myself with others constantly.  But my disability does not affect my ability to serve God.  God knows our limitations and desires only that we are prepared and willing to go where God leads and to do God’s will.


As I drive to a friend’s house, I notice a new sporting goods store.  I think about the great sales they must be having for their grand opening and all of the fun things I could buy for camping.  Then I turn my thoughts to the next day: Ash Wednesday.

This holy day marks a time when I try to think about moderation.  Living in moderation is a daily challenge for me.  From grocery shopping, to eating, to going to new stores, it is difficult to eat and purchase only what is necessary without splurging on a little more here and there.

As I approach the store, my thoughts shift to the apostle Paul, who learned to be content in all circumstances.  He was satisfied whether he was feasting or starving, whether he had many possessions or none.  Having an excess of goods or of food clutters my life—body, soul, and mind—without providing any lasting, deep-rooted happiness.  They require time and energy to maintain, which distracts me from nurturing my relationship with God.

I turn my eyes back to the road and pass the new store.  Today I will make an effort to live more freely, with less stuff to hold me down and distract me from God.


The members of the church had chosen to bring in the new year with a worship service that night.  Ahead of time, many had declined to come, saying they had other places to go and people to visit.  By midnight, no one had arrived.

I was sad because I had spent a great deal of time preparing the program.  Soon a young boy who attends Sunday school came by.  He said, “Pastor, let’s go ahead with the service.”  I said, “I don’t think so.  No one is here.”  The young boy looked at me and said, “But three of us are here — you, me and Jesus.” (See Matt. 18:20.)

I realized that the purpose of this service was not simply to gather the people but to worship God and receive God’s blessings.  After we sang a few joyous songs, neighbors from the area began to join us.  It was a spirit-filled night, and many came to know Christ.

This experience reminded me of the parable of the great dinner in Luke 14.  After the host sent the invitations and received the news that the guests were not coming, he extended the invitation to include people from the “roads and lanes.”  Our dinner became a true feast, where those who came truly wanted to be there.  And they were fed by the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ.


One Ash Wednesday, I attended a graveside funeral service for a 16-year-old boy, the son of family friends.  He had died in an automobile accident days before.  As the mourners gathered by the freshly turned earth, grief washed over us.  “Why?” seemed to be the question on everyone’s lips.  “Why did this boy, bright with promise who loved God passionately, die so young?”

No one knows why tragedies occur.  But remembering the whole picture helps me.  As Christians, we know that our story does not end on Ash Wednesday.  Nor does it end on Good Friday.  Early on Sunday, the stone rolled away; Jesus emerged alive from a dark tomb and eternally shattered the grip of death.  On resurrection morning, Jesus gave us the ability to look death straight in the eyes, and say, “It isn’t over.”  To those who put their trust in the resurrected One, Jesus gives the assurance of eternal life.  Jesus’ words, “The one who believes in me will live, even though they die” (John 11:25), bring immeasurable comfort and hope to any who would believe — especially those dealing with the loss of a loved one.


Early one morning, I walked along a rural road, enjoying the cool air before the summer sun rose.  Suddenly, I became aware of a rustling in the pasture beside me.  I peered into the darkness and saw the dim outlines of perhaps a hundred sheep.  Apparently mistaking me for their shepherd, the sheep had decided to follow me.  As I strode along the road, the sheep trotted in the pasture beside me until a fence stopped them.  They could still see me, but they could no longer follow me.  I heard their plaintive bleats growing fainter and fainter as I continued my walk.

The Bible often compares us to sheep.  Like sheep, we may go astray by following someone who is not our shepherd.  Like sheep, we are easily frightened when venturing into unfamiliar territory.  Like sheep, we need a shepherd to guide us, to protect us, to lead us to clean water and green pastures.

Christ is our shepherd.  He does not walk away from us, leaving us bewildered and forlorn.  He does not wait for us to come to him, but comes to us and teaches us his ways: kindness, compassion, and courage in the face of opposition and adversity.  Listening to Jesus, we find our way.


I grew up at a time in our country when the word God was written without a capital letter.  Belief in God was viewed as irrational behavior.  But on a particular day every spring, homes were filled with unusual baking smells and decorated eggs; there was a festive sense in the air.  I enjoyed baking kulich (Russian Easter cake) and decorating eggs.  Often people went to the cemetery.  In many cases, this was the only day in the year when deceased relatives were remembered.  If you had a table laden with Easter dishes and had been to the cemetery, then Easter had been celebrated well.

Then I came to the Lord.  I discovered that decorating eggs is not important; an abundant table is not necessary; and one can visit the graves of loved ones any day.

For me, Easter became a festival of light.  Even if the clouds blocked the sun on Easter, the light of Christ illuminated the day.  I don’t think I will ever understand the deep meaning of Christ’s coming to earth.  But I can feel his endless love.  And it gives me joy to know that Easter is a miracle that is directly connected to me.


The woman described in the scripture reading for today is one of my heroes.  Her bleeding disorder made her unclean according to the law (Lev. 15:19).  No one could touch her, and she could be punished for making another person unclean by touching him or her.  Out of her tremendous need, she put aside her pride and her fear of the consequences, boldly came up behind Jesus, and touched his cloak.  When Jesus turned to her, she fell to the ground, trembling at his feet, and declared to everyone why she had touched Jesus and that she had been healed.

As I picture the scene, I see Jesus bending down, taking the woman by the arm and saying, “Daughter, your faith has healed you.  Go in peace.”

The scripture shows that if we are willing to humble ourselves before God, God will show us mercy.  Isaiah 30:18 (NIV) says, “The Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show you compassion.”  If, like the woman Jesus healed, we leave behind our pride and fear and come boldly before God, we can be healed.


When our small intercessory prayer group had to stop meeting in person, I felt completely discouraged.  The five of us had met every Thursday evening in our church and spent an hour or more in prayer together.

But despite my discouragement, through technology our prayer group grew and became even more effective for us.  So many people now possess mobile phones, allowing prayer requests to be circulated instantaneously to all of us.  We even receive prayer requests from people of other faiths.

Our prayer chain has many more links than the five original members, and our prayer time is no longer confined to an hour on Thursdays.  We can now lift our requests to God on any day and at any time.

We can always trust God, our loving Father, to be at work creating new opportunities to serve and new and different ways for us to accomplish God’s purpose.


During a mission trip to Ecuador, I visited a Quichua Indian church located high in the windswept Andes Mountains.  The pastor and his wife were proudly showing our volunteer team their church building when we saw a huge pile of yellow corn spilling out of gunnysacks in the corner of one room.  I asked if there was any special significance to the mound of corn.  They explained that in their agricultural community the believers always brought a tenth of whatever crop they harvested to the church as an offering to the Lord.  The congregation used this food to share with those in their village who did not have enough to eat or to provide a meal on special days for their entire community as a testimony to God’s love and provision in their lives.

I was amazed and moved at this level of generosity, gratitude, and obedience.  What could happen in our own churches if we each chose to give back to the Lord literally a tenth of all we have?  What needs could we meet with these resources?


I admit I’ve made many mistakes, broken a million promises and lied about both.  I have driven while drunk, saying, “I’m sober.”  Through it all I’ve lost respect and ruined trust.  I said, “I’m sorry,” but my apology rang hollow.

God gave me chances.  I had plenty of opportunities to behave differently in my life, in my marriage, and in my other relationships, but for a long time I did not.  Then I listened to a Sunday school teacher.  Through my fog-filled head, I heard her say, “Anyone can empty his or her glass and fill it up with something life-giving.”

God spoke to me through those words, and as I embraced the truth of them, I was finally able to change.  Temptation did not end, but I began to cooperate with God and filled my glass with the Holy Spirit.

Now I tell anyone able to listen that I’m no one special; if Jesus healed me, he’s willing to do the same for anyone.  Yesterday, I filled my glass with stuff that hurt me; but today, I choose to drink what God offers because I am now aware that my emptiness can be filled with life instead of death.


Five years ago, I faced a painful loss: the breakup of my 20-year marriage.  Though I was a psychologist and had counseled others through similar situations, I felt that I would not be able to overcome my sorrow alone.  All my life, especially during my childhood and adolescence, I had heard Philippians 4:13; but I never stopped to realize its importance.  The message speaks about the truth and power of the promise of Jesus Christ.

I turned to God.  Through this personal spiritual connection, I learned that God is always present to comfort our spirits and to sustain us in challenging times.  Without God in my life, I would not have been able to overcome my pain and sadness.

Today I live strengthened by God’s love.  My prayer is that God’s presence may reside in each person who is hurting.


On a recent vacation, my family visited Cades Cove, a valley in the Great Smoky Mountains.  We drove along the road, taking in the scenery and stopping along the way at historical sites:  cabins, churches, and a rustic mill.  We hoped to see wildlife, including bears.

I remember standing in a meadow, in an open space with no barriers, no inhibitions, no limits; and I felt free.  Then I remembered that the bears ranged free, too.  It struck me: Am I really safe here?

We live in a culture that wants no fences; we want the freedom to do whatever we choose, but we also want to be secure.  Christ said that within the boundaries of truth, we are free (John 8:32), free from danger, temptation, deception, and insecurity.  To be free within boundaries seems like a contradiction.  But if I stood in the valley within sight of a bear, I wouldn’t feel free at all; I might even feel trapped.

Living within the boundaries of the truth of Christ, we are safe, whole, and at rest.


When five of my relatives visited one night for a family meal, I noticed that we didn’t have enough food to make it around the table.  I caught my mom’s eye and nodded at the platter of beef.  She understood and made a gesture as if to say, “Don’t worry about it.”

Mom finished eating dinner before everyone else; then I realized she had taken the smallest piece of beef to make sure that no one walked away from the table hungry.

Many times, I have seen my mom think of others before she thinks of herself.  My mom’s loving sacrifices remind me of the ultimate sacrifice God made for us.  God sacrificed “his only begotten Son” to atone for our sins.  Occasionally, we forget or are simply unaware of how great God’s sacrifice was.  We must remember and pass on our understanding of God’s sacrificial love.

I have tried to follow my mom’s example of putting others’ needs before her own.  Someday I hope to show my children how our daily sacrifices can be small reflections of God’s love.


I was camping in a heavily wooded area and had walked to a nearby lake to watch the beautiful sunset.  In the near dark, I discovered that the batteries on my flashlight were almost worn out.  I would have to make my way back to camp on an unfamiliar path in the dark woods with only a feeble light for a guide.

The flashlight dimly illuminated the path.  Rocks and tree roots that hadn’t mattered in the daylight made the trip difficult in darkness.  But by using caution, I was able to walk back to camp with only a few minor stumbles.

Scripture explains that God’s word is a lamp and a light for believers.  While not showing the entire path, it lights up a step or two ahead to prepare us for obstacles that may lie in front of us.

The guidance God gives in the Bible helps illuminate the bumpy paths we travel in life.  Through daily prayer and Bible study, we are equipped to meet the trials and opportunities of daily living.  We can walk through life confidently while staying within the light of God’s loving instruction.


I wanted the youth to think I was the greatest.  I wanted them to tell their friends, “Hey, come to our church; our youth pastor is amazing.”  When we planned a countywide event, I wanted to make it incredible; but organizing the event was a struggle because of my motivation: I was trying to prove myself, rather than focusing on what God was doing in our community.

Satan tried to force Jesus to prove himself by taunting, “Since you are God’s Son. . .”.  But Jesus didn’t take the bait because he didn’t need to prove himself.  Jesus knew who he was and what he was to do.  He also knew that Satan wanted him to focus on himself rather than on God.  Jesus defeated Satan’s scheme by quoting God’s word and glorified God through his obedience.

We may feel that we need to prove ourselves, but our job is to point people to God.  We don’t need to prove that we are good enough for God.  God approves of us and considers us valuable enough to send Christ to earth to die for our sins.  God already loves us.


As I was having a blood test, the clinician noticed that we shared the same birthday.  Then she looked disheartened, as she told me the day’s horoscope message for Pisces people like us: “Don’t expect all your dreams to come true.”  I had the impression that she felt discouraged about more than her horoscope.

Out of my mouth came the words, “I don’t really believe in horoscopes.  God is much bigger than a horoscope, and he can make your dreams come true.”  I saw her face light up; she looked more hopeful.

I had often prayed for opportunities for God to use me despite my timid nature.  I felt encouraged that God had given me the words to reassure her and also the boldness to share them.  We both were encouraged.  I pray that she will come to know Jesus as her Savior and that she can put her hope and trust in him.


Shortly after celebrating my 75th birthday, I sensed a calling from God to become involved in an ecumenical prison ministry called Kairos.  With significant reluctance — but with prayer — I eventually responded to the prodding of God’s Spirit and am now involved in ministry with three different correctional facilities.

What a remarkable learning experience this has proved to be — beginning with the fact that God’s timing (kairos in Greek) is so very different from the time kept by the watch I wear on my wrist (chronos).  While I have tried to serve God throughout my life, what a joy it is to know that we can be useful and usable at any age!

Paul’s instructions in Philippians 2:12 apply to each of us individually.  For me that means continuing to listen for and to obey God’s call on my time and resources.

As a follower of Jesus I pray that all of us will find our calling from God.  The list provided in Matthew 25 — feeding the hungry and thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick or imprisoned, or befriending the lonely — is a good place to start.


Her name was Tee.  She had been a patient several times on the Palliative Care Unit where I am a music volunteer.  With an inoperable tumor on her spine slowly sapping her strength, she had come to the end of her life’s journey.  She lay on her special air bed, her face slack and unresponsive.  In the room with her were her husband and her two small children, as well as her mother and sisters and a host of friends.  I pulled out one of my wooden flutes and played a song for her.  As the last note was sounding, Tee passed from this life.  She was only 28 years old.  Most would say Tee died too young.

The followers of Jesus probably thought the same thing as they watched him die.  I’m sure they thought that was the end of the story, but we now know that it wasn’t.  Because Jesus overcame death, he lives in our hearts and lives today.

It wasn’t the end of Tee’s story either.  She lives on in her two little girls and in the love that her family had for her.  She lives on in the eternal life promised to us through Jesus Christ.


 “Come see,” I called to my mom; and she would leave the laundry to study an inchworm.  When my experiment was complete, she returned to the unfolded clothes.  “Mom, let’s go for a ride.”  Though she had been elbow-deep in dishwater, she would join me for a jeep ride.  When we returned, she finished the dishes.  Mom saw these interruptions as opportunities to build a relationship with me — her youngest child.

The healing of the paralytic is one example of how Jesus dealt with interruptions.  When other people found Jesus involved in something else, they interrupted.  Our savior seldom objected; he stopped, listened, and met their need.  Jesus was available to those who needed him.

We may feel we have no room for interruptions.  But suspending our ordinary duties to reach out to other people could be the defining moment in their lives and possibly in ours.  By considering the way Jesus responded to interruptions, we can begin to view interruptions as opportunities to be Jesus for other people.


Our lives are full of changes — some good and some not so good.  Most of us dislike change; we often go kicking and screaming into a new way of thinking or a new way of doing things.  Nevertheless, we know that we will experience change from time to time.

Sometimes we even embrace change, especially when it improves our physical or emotional comfort.  We often make changes to improve our image, the way we look, with new clothes or new hairstyles.  But while such changes may affect the way others see us, they are only one aspect of our being — the exterior.

Sometimes it is more difficult to embrace inner changes.  Changing our inner selves begins with prayer.  Have we asked God to help us be free from hatred, resentment, a lack of forgiveness?  Have we asked to be free from fear or pride that can easily harm us and others?

Maybe Psalm 51, David’s prayer, is a good place for us to start: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.”


Recently our Jewish friends celebrated the feast of Purim, which commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people from death.  King Xerxes I of Persia had ordered the eradication of all the Jews in his kingdom.  This would have included Mordecai and possibly even his niece, Xerxes’ own Queen Esther (whose Jewish heritage had been hidden).  This led Mordecai to issue Esther a challenge to plead with the king on behalf of her people: “Who knows whether you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”

This is a question for all of us!  In each generation, God appoints men and women to work for justice in that age.  We are alive in this amazing day and hour when the whole world is longing for answers and God is saying, “Whom shall I send?  And who will go for us?” He is awaiting those who will come forward and say, “Here am I.  Send me!”  But know this: Deliverance will come for all those who trust in God.  We all can ask ourselves, Would I rather God use someone else for the task chosen for me?

God calls each of us, and each of us can rise to the occasion!


While a pastor in Three Rivers, Michigan, I became good friends with one of the other pastors in our community.  Over the 18 years I ministered in that community, he and I exchanged pulpits often.  On other occasions I was privileged to hear him preach.  After making a particular point he would say, “Can I get a witness?”  He was saying, “Is there someone who agrees with me?”

Perhaps that is the essence of witnessing — agreeing with Jesus by sharing with others the experiences we have had since we turned our lives over to him.  This includes the good, bad, and ugly experiences that we all have during our lives; Jesus has been with us through them all.  In his defense before King Agrippa, the apostle Paul told of how he persecuted believers and then later how God had chosen him to “bear witness to the lowly and the great” (Acts 26:22, CEB).

Thomas Aquinas once stated that when you want to convert a person to your view, you go over to where he is standing, take him by the hand, and guide him.  You don’t stand across the room and shout at him.  This is what we need to do: take the hands of those around us and guide them to the love and salvation of Jesus Christ.


Early one morning as I stood motionless on the back deck sipping my coffee, a ruby-throated hummingbird hovered just inches away from my face, beak to nose.  I could feel the rush of air from his wings.  Incredibly, he appeared to be as fascinated with me as I was with him!

After that experience, I wanted to know as much as I could about hummingbirds — their habits and their habitats, what they ate, and what kind of flowers they liked.  I wanted to spend more time with these fascinating creatures.  Personal experience is often like that.  The more intimate our encounter with something or someone, the more profound our desire to know and experience more.

This is especially true in our search to know God.  The Bible points the way for us to experience an intimate and personal relationship with Jesus.  Knowing God is about encounter!  And when we truly experience the love of the living Christ through the scriptures and the circumstances of our lives, we always want more.


The telephone rang at 2 a.m.  “This is the police department.  We’ve picked up a mother and three children.  The kids are in pretty bad shape.”

Such calls have become a routine part of my life in my almost 30 years as a social worker.  Witnessing the physical, sexual, and emotional abuse or severe neglect inflicted by out-of-control adults has colored my world and filled me with deep anger.  Sorrow followed anger as I saw many children had learned the defense, “I’m gonna hurt you before you hurt me.”  I knew that without intervention, they could easily follow their abusive parents’ pattern.

Many of these adults had never experienced genuine love and acceptance.  They didn’t know how to appropriately care for a child.  Often I was tempted to go through the motions of trying to help them without showing genuine love and respect.  But I learned that when I allowed God to love through me — to change me — I increased the likelihood of seeing lasting change in both parents and children.  By confessing my own brokenness, I could more effectively minister to theirs.  When we acknowledge our own imperfections, we can point others to God’s love, which heals the brokenness in each of us.


My wife and I were driving through a desolate area when our dirt road entered a shadowed mountain gorge, winding beside a stream.  Above us towered enormous rock buttresses.  Time and time again we seemed to face a dead end in the road.  At the last moment, the single lane wound around a huge rock and continued before us.  Because there was barely enough space to turn around, our fear was that the road would truly dead-end, leaving us stranded.  Finally, after endless heart-stopping twists and turns, we entered a spacious valley with grazing sheep and cattle.  We had passed through the heart of that dreaded mountain range.

Sometimes life is like that road: we seem about to be trapped in a dead end, with no apparent way of escape.  Our dead end may be financial, marital, or health-related.  How wonderful to hear God say, “I am about to do a new thing: . . . I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.”  The way may be narrow and tough, but God makes a way.  The Lord has done this for me over and over, and in the time of my worst fears, I trust God to do it again.


My mother was 95 years old when she died.  Two weeks prior to her death, she was signing birthday cards.  But she didn’t select only the few needed for the next two months; she signed cards to be used through the next six months.  Then she mailed them.  On the outside of each envelope my mother wrote, “Better early than never.”  In her own way, my mother was preparing us for her death.

Jesus did the same with his disciples.  In his last months on earth, he told them, “When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to me.”  He was preparing them for his death, but he didn’t stop there.  He also said, “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8, NRSV).  Jesus was preparing his disciples for his death and for their life!

It is the same for us.  Prepared for death, we still mourn our loss.  Prepared for life, we become witnesses for Christ.  I want to be prepared for both.


I never attended church growing up, so for me Easter was all about hunting eggs and getting a day off from school or work.  Even after I began attending church regularly, I still didn’t completely understand what was special about Easter, or what the Resurrection meant.

At that time my focus was more on being successful.  I had built for myself the life that I thought I had always wanted.  But then I developed epilepsy, and a 30-year career was suddenly ended.  Unable to work, or even to drive, I felt dead inside.  Life as I had known it was over.  All I could think of was, Lord, what will I do now?

It would have been easy then to lose all hope and just give up.  But after much prayerful thought and consideration, I realized that even though my old life might have ended, there was still much that I could do.  So, I began to put my efforts into the ministries of the church.  As God gave new meaning to my life, the message of Easter has become clear to me.  No matter what disasters we face, with God’s help we can build from the ashes — and with Jesus, experience new life.


Peter had doubts.  That’s why he started to sink.  But when he had faith, he was walking on water!  I am learning that when we have faith, we, too, can do amazing things.

When I first started my Monday morning choir club in a small Ukrainian town, I had some doubts about my ability to conduct such a club.  And, of course, when I first thought about becoming a volunteer English teacher in a country far from home, I had even more doubts.  But I felt that volunteering would open doors for me to share God’s love with new people.  So, I decided to have faith in God and follow the call to Ukraine.

Monday is becoming my favorite day of the week.  I have so much fun singing and dancing that sometimes I think I may be more excited about it than my fifth graders.  With God’s love and mercy, we can find the strength and courage to step out in faith and do extraordinary things.


Since childhood, I have struggled with stuttering.  In elementary school I hated reading in front of my classmates.  Family members were impatient, and friends teased me by asking me to say words I couldn’t pronounce.  My speech problem became a joke that I learned to laugh about as well.  Then, one day, while reading my Bible I began to notice the word ask.  That’s it, I thought to myself.  Jesus told us we could ask for anything in his name and he would do it.

In prayer, I began to cry out, asking God to take this aggravation from me.  God’s response came when I stumbled across a website dedicated to people who stutter.  It suggested that sometimes stuttering can be worsened by not breathing deeply enough before speaking.  Really?  I thought.  Could it be that simple?  I began to remind myself to breathe deeply before speaking, and my stuttering problem slowly went away.

We all have personal issues and unfortunate life circumstances that God wants to help us with.  What are we holding on to that can be given to God?  Whatever it is, if we trust what Jesus promised in John 14:14, we can pray daily, asking for help.  Then we can wait expectantly for God’s answer.


I love crosses.  I wear one on a necklace around my neck at all times.  I have many crosses in my home that I have brought back from mission trips and travels to other countries.  They remind me of where I’ve been and the people who made them.

But beyond that, I wonder, What message are we sending when we wear a cross or display one in our home?  As a Roman instrument of capital punishment, a cross was where Jesus and many others died.  But Jesus was removed from a cross and rose from death in the resurrection.  For Christians, the cross is not the end of the story.  It’s the place where heaven and earth met in one momentous event that changed the world.

During Lent, we sing lots of hymns about the cross.  And at Easter, we raise our alleluias to the empty cross that reminds us that Jesus is not dead but rose again.  The message of the cross is as simple and as complex as that:  Because Jesus lives even now, we have the hope of eternal life in heaven.


Many times, King David, the writer of Psalm 23, needed to have his soul restored — to have life put back into him.  When Saul was chasing David and threatening to kill him, God restored David’s courage and confidence.  During those days of grief after David lost his son Absalom in death, God restored his soul.  When David sinned with Bathsheba and felt the heavy hand of God on him as a result, God restored his soul also restored relationship with him.

In this psalm, that relationship is depicted as a shepherd with his sheep.  When a sheep has lots of wool and falls over onto its side, it is very difficult for it to get up again.  After a few hours, the sheep’s stomach will expand with gases and eventually compress its lungs.  If the shepherd doesn’t intervene to restore the sheep to an upright position and then massage its legs to restore circulation, the sheep will soon die.

In a similar way, when sins or trials put us flat on our backs, overwhelming us with grief and despair, it takes a shepherd to restore our souls.  As we pray, read and meditate on scripture, and fellowship with other believers, our Shepherd reassures us with his grace and mercy and gives us back our strength, joy, and courage.


Our house was in foreclosure, I couldn’t pay the bills, I had been denied public assistance, and I had three young children counting on me.  I was angry, ashamed, and afraid.  I felt emotionally and spiritually dead.

When I desperately cried out to God for help, I felt God say to me, as Christ commanded Lazarus, “Come out!”  Through my tears, I could sense God’s loving whisper, “You don’t need to hide in shame.  Let your friends and family know what you’re dealing with.  I’ll walk through this with you.”

Trusting in God, I realized that my fear of being judged was unwarranted.  When I talked about my situation with my family and with Christian friends, I received love and support.  They helped unbind me from fear and shame.  For the first time in many years, I was free.  I could move in a positive, healthy direction, knowing that God was and always had been by my side.

Whenever we are bound by anger, shame, or fear we can cry out to God and trust God to be with us.  We can be unbound and free.  A wonderful world waits for us, as do the people who love us and need us.


As an experienced mountain climber, I should have known better than to hike without a detailed map.  I got to my designated point of departure without any trouble.  But while the trail was marked pretty well, I did encounter false paths, fields crowded with boulders with no visible trail, and places where the markers were either faded by time or obscured by new tree growth and moss.  Therefore, I spent the time on the trail having to search for the next marker, stare at overly simplified directions, or double back to a known trail position.  A detailed map would have allowed me to hike with confidence, to admire the beauty of the vistas, flora, and fauna, and to enjoy the peace and quiet away from the city.

This experience reminded me of the importance of spiritual touchstones.  Without worship, prayer, and Bible study the path of my Christian journey is not as clear, and I find I’m less comfortable as I approach the different turns and false paths of life.  Continual reading, discussion, and meditation make our walk with Christ more meaningful and joyful, giving us a fresh sense of where we need to be heading.


White flowers adorned the altar, and the youth group had taken special care to decorate the old church building for the Easter service.  The church was overflowing; people stood in the balcony and outside.  As a congregation we stood and sang, “Crown him, Lord of lords.”  I felt as if we were a part of the crowning ceremony of our Lord Jesus Christ.  I had seen many pictures of kings and leaders being crowned, and I felt blessed to be part of crowning the King.  Jesus our Lord gave up his Father’s kingdom to become mortal and to sacrifice his life so that we could be saved.

As we drove home from the church service, the song still lingered in my mind.  I wondered what kind of crown I had placed on the head of Jesus — the kingly crown of a faithful life or the thorny crown of a sinful life?  Singing with the congregation made me realize that we can examine our hearts and acknowledge that we need our Lord.  After that, we can repent and offer our hearts to the One who saved us, who shed his blood for us.  Our humble, repentant hearts are precious jewels in the crown of our Lord Jesus Christ.


Recently I received a message from an old friend who was having trouble loving one of his family members.  My advice to the friend was to pray for the situation.  Then I suggested that he call or go to the family member and tell them how he felt.  I told him that I believed that God would be with him as he talked to the family member about the matter.

It may be very hard to put aside our differences and ask God to help us love those who have hurt us.  Yet, in John 13:34 Jesus says that we are to love one another.  Certainly, loving someone who has hurt us — or someone we love — is not easy.  Jesus shows us the way; we love others as he loved us.  Jesus loved us so much that he was willing to die for us: “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.  And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.”  I think this means that we are to love everyone, even those we find very hard to love.

And when we love in this way, the world will notice: Jesus said, “By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:35, NIV).


In today’s reading, Jesus assured his apostles that they would receive eternal life.  Then in the very next verse, he told them that he was going to Jerusalem to die a violent death.  After leaving behind jobs and family to follow Jesus, they had to face the reality that the One they were following would soon die.  They might have been wondering if they were going to have to die too.

Sometimes today our journey with Christ involves leaving our old lives.  When I was considering graduate schools, I visited one far from my hometown.  I felt called there but wrestled with the decision.  I feared leaving the established for the unknown, letting go of possibilities closer to home, and losing things that I cherished about my life at the time.

This passage from Luke 18 encouraged me.  Sometimes following Christ can mean leaving familiar, expected, secure things behind.  It can mean facing the death of comfortable patterns and even potential opportunities.  In following faithfully where God calls, we can witness new life — just as the disciples witnessed abundant new life on Easter morning.


During Easter week, I attended a Christian conference where we celebrated Communion together.  We formed a line down the center aisle, and two elderly men stood up front to serve us.  Receiving the elements of Communion in this way was different for me; at my home church, we pass the plates of bread and grape juice to each other as we remain seated.

While I waited in line, I noticed that the men up front spoke to each person they served, though I couldn’t hear what they said.  When it was my turn, the man holding the bread looked at me with kind eyes and said, “Nancy, the body of Christ, broken for you.”  I took a piece of bread and dipped it in the cup of grape juice.  The man holding the cup said, “Nancy, the blood of Christ, shed for you.”

My eyes blurred with tears as I made my way back to my seat, overwhelmed with emotion.  Though I knew that both men had read my conference name tag, somehow hearing my name spoken out Ioud had made this Communion personal, as if Jesus himself had served me.

This experience — and my response to it — reminded me that sometimes I get so busy, so distracted, that I forget Jesus’ great suffering on the cross for my sins.  No wonder Paul encourages us to take time to remember.  He said, “As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.”


Ever since my son, Steve, died in 2006, I have looked at Easter a little differently.  The first Holy Week after his death was hard, but after some reflection, it took on new meaning.  As I thought about this Lenten period, I started with Palm Sunday — a day of celebration.  We are on top of the world.  We are triumphant and joyful.

Often our lives follow the pattern of Holy Week.  We have to go through the trials, the days of prayer and preparation, the Thursdays of betrayal and the washing of feet, the Fridays of death, and the Saturdays where God seems silent.  We think the Sundays will never come, but they do!  Praise God!  There is new life — the power of resurrection to sustain us.

I am learning and making note of this process.  Life will have more triumphs, more times for fervent prayer, more trials, more suffering, more heartbreak, more betrayal, more death, but also more Sundays when Christ’s triumph over death leads us forward into new life.


I remember when Megan was first learning to play the piano.  She became frustrated because she couldn’t just sit down and play a song.  She had to struggle and practice for hours.  Finally she became really good.  Now she can play many different songs.  There are times when she will play while I am cleaning the kitchen, and I love to listen!  When she continues to practice, she gets better and better every day.

Sometimes we set similarly unrealistic expectations for our faith.  We accept Christ as our Savior and think we should instantly have perfect lives.  We expect our faith should be strong enough to move mountains.  But just like playing the piano, maturing in faith takes practice.  Faith is like a muscle that needs to be worked in order to grow and stay strong.  The more we read the Bible and spend time with God in prayer, the stronger we become in our faith.  As the psalmist says, God’s word will be a sweet taste to us, like honey to our mouths.  (See Ps. 119:103.)  God’s word will help us stay on the right path.  Through continuing practice, we become wise in the ways of our Lord and Savior.


I was a very young man when I entered Bible college to prepare for full-time ministry.  I felt inadequate for the demanding work that lay ahead.  Who was I to imagine that I could be a leader and pastor of God’s people?  But throughout my time in college, we spoke a lot about Joshua’s experience.  I realized that Joshua probably felt the same as I did when he was faced with the challenge of leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.  Maybe that is why Moses repeatedly urged him to be strong and courageous.  He was keenly aware that by himself he lacked the resources for the demands of leadership in the years ahead.  Joshua knew his limitations.

As we face the challenges of our day, we too may feel inadequate and weak.  But God still calls us to serve.  It remains true that “God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong” (1 Cor. 1:27).  But it is also still true that whom God calls God also equips.  God’s grace is sufficient for every task.


On the day we refer to as Palm Sunday Jesus passed through the gates of Jerusalem on his way to keep God’s promise.  The crowd and the disciples praised him, but Jesus said that if they didn’t, the rocks would!  All things God made can glorify their Creator.

But can I?  I know that sometimes I am disobedient and resistant to correction, and because I struggle with mental illness, my thoughts are scattered, my social cues all wrong.  I despair of myself, questioning if the love and praise of someone like me has value.  But this scripture reminds me that even rocks can praise the Creator, and I have been created to praise God, too.

One way I can praise God is through singing in my church choir.  Praise music has helped me memorize scripture.  Through constant repetition at choir rehearsals, scripture set to music has shaped me and is now with me always.  Even when it is hard for me to focus, I can remember who God is and what God has done for me.  Despairing or joyful, I can draw near to God.  The Lord rejoices over me with singing (see Zeph. 3:17), and like the rocks, I sing back!


The large advertising poster outside the church showed me that the address I had prepared would not fit this occasion.  I had mistakenly believed that I was to speak at a women’s rally.  Instead, I now saw that my audience would consist of representatives from churches around the district.  I went into the church feeling numb with desperation.

What am I going to say to these good people when my turn comes to address them?  I hadn’t a clue and still didn’t know even while sitting beside the pulpit, ready to be introduced as speaker.  Help me, Lord!  I pleaded.

Then into my mind came clear direction: Imaginatively present Gospel stories as you do with your group.  In our women’s Bible study group when looking at the Gospels, we enter into the story and become part of it.  For example, when we study the passage about the Wedding at Cana, we “attend” the wedding.  This way of looking at the Gospels is not new.  It was practiced by St. Ignatius of Loyola.

I stood up, all fear gone, and took the congregation on several imaginary journeys into Gospel scenes.  They were totally focused on my presentation and listened with rapt attention.  I had once more discovered that God helps us when we admit our helplessness.


“I am excited to see what God has planned.”  I heard these words from a co-worker who lost a full-time job and benefits due to company downsizing.  Someone who was unsure of where she would be working the next day was at peace — calm and secure in God’s care.

Within a short time my irritation and anxiety with the cutbacks began to evaporate in the warmth of the trust in God that radiated from this co-worker.  From her calm assurance in God’s care for her family, serenity drifted to every corner of the once-unsettled office.

I continue to grow from my co-worker’s example by exchanging my thoughts of worry for belief.  I can trust in God to care for me and my family today and in the future.  God delivers peace into the dull routine as well as the most frustrating circumstances.

As I have learned from this experience, a struggling economy — and even downsizing — does not define a relationship with God.  Even in the midst of unsettling situations, trusting in God can bring perfect peace.


Eager to accept the challenge to keep watch with Jesus, during Lent I set aside a time to pray for one hour.  As I see Easter approaching, I remember Christ’s agony in Gethsemane, his disappointment over one who betrayed him and one who denied him.  On the cross, Jesus poured out his blood to purchase eternal life for me and for all who believe.  I’m awestruck by such great love!

After a time, I ran out of words to express this love, and I began to think of other things.  I thought about a family dealing with a job loss.  I prayed that the right job would open up.  I prayed for the children’s emotional well-being.  I prayed that financial needs would be met.  I wondered, What can I do to help in a tangible way?  When the answer came, I extended my prayer to follow through with action.

In my hour of watching with Jesus, I discovered that there are many ways to pray: Write an uplifting note to someone who is ill or going through a tough time.  Prepare meals for a family in crisis.  Take a person who is homebound to lunch or to a medical appointment.  Anything we do to improve the well-being of another one of God’s people can be a way of  “watching with Jesus.”


I had taken part in foot washing and Communion in my home church every Thursday before Easter since my youth.  As a pastor, I had made preparations for such services.

This day’s service was much the same, though the setting was different.  This service was taking place in Kenya, East Africa, where I was a missionary — and the feet I was washing belonged to my dear friend and co-worker, Jackson.

Jackson had responsibility for overseeing several churches among his father’s tribe, the Maasai.  Transportation to the more remote villages was limited so his feet had thickly calloused soles and scars from walking to and from the churches.  As I washed his feet, I realized how beautiful they were because, like the feet of Jesus, they brought good news wherever they went.

Our small acts of service may go unnoticed or unappreciated by the world, but they are noticed by the Lord of life.  What a privilege it is to serve in the same spirit of love that motivated Jesus!


I attend a Christian university and was recently required to read an article about the physiological changes that Christ would have experienced during his crucifixion.  Holy Week is a time to remember that Christ died for our sins, but most of the time I’m only vaguely aware of the reality of his death.  Reading about the hours of Christ’s torture and physical degradation, I couldn’t help but sob, “God, make it stop!”  I was only reading about the event.  How must Jesus’ mother have felt?  How must God have felt?

I was consumed by a deep sorrow for such irrepressible cruelty.  At the same time I was flooded with gratitude, fully aware that Christ willingly submitted to this terrible death on the cross.  As I thought of what Jesus said at the Last Supper, “Do this in remembrance,” I realized that we are to remember not only who Jesus was but also how and why he died.  I am overwhelmingly grateful.


Jesus had been crucified.  His life was over.  Women standing nearby watched as his body was removed from the cross and taken away for burial.  Then they departed for home.  Resolved to honor one last time the man they had followed, they prepared embalming spices and perfumes for the Lord’s body.

I try to imagine what the women were feeling.  Jesus claimed to be the Christ, yet he died a criminal’s death.  Hope surely gave way to confusion and disappointment as their minds cried out, It’s all over.  He was not the Messiah.

Many times in my life I have stopped believing just short of answered prayer.  When God’s answer seemed to be “no,” my optimism would turn to defeated acceptance.  But later I would rejoice to discover that what seemed the end of hope was only a delay, a difference between God’s timing and mine.

The women who went home to prepare spices and perfumes teach us how to handle times when all seems lost.  We can continue in prayer, do what seems right, and trust that at any moment, God may pour out rich blessings on our lives.  God raised Jesus from the grave.  We are God’s children too.  What will God do for us?


When I was a little girl, my parents hid my Easter basket in unusual places.  When I woke up, I followed clues that led me all over the house, into the yard, and even into the barn.  Scrambled messages encouraged me to look in odd places.  I found my basket tucked in the ironing closet, in the car, or behind a hay bale.  What joy to find Easter goodies waiting for me!

Easter celebrates good news hidden in surprising places.  Who would think to discover new life in a graveyard?  Who expects crying to turn into joy?  Who imagines forgiveness in despair?  On Easter morning, the women discovered the risen Christ in the midst of their sorrow and tears.

At times we think that God has forgotten us, but God promises to find us even in the darkest valleys and the farthest corners of the world.  We should not be surprised to discover God wherever we are in need.  In hospital rooms, in moments of fear, in times of disagreement and confusion, God astonishes us with grace and love.  Easter reminds us to have open hearts and spirits so that we can see God in unusual places.  Let us rejoice; the risen Christ is with us today and always.  Alleluia!


On a Sunday morning, there’s nowhere I’d rather be than in worship.  But for many people church is not their first choice, unless it’s Easter or Christmas Eve.

Last Easter I chatted with some visitors after church.  “Loved it!” one 30-something man said.  “If church were like this every week I’d probably come.”  Two of our young families turned around and joined the conversation.  “It is like this every week,” they said.  ‘This place is alive all the time; that’s the whole point of Easter!”

I left the visiting family deep in conversation with our vibrant, “living” church members.  But I didn’t forget what they said.  Jesus’ followers should be alive all the time; that’s the whole point of Easter.


We live on top of a tall ridge in East Tennessee in a beautiful setting with a panoramic view of the Great Smoky Mountains.  Frequently this serene setting is interrupted by the beat of the medical helicopter from the University of Tennessee Medical Center, which flies over our home on its way to the hospital.

When we first began noticing the helicopter, we were bothered by the noise.  As time went on, we realized that each flight meant that someone was in dire medical need.  Each time we heard the helicopter, we would pray — for the crew and the people involved with this mission of mercy, that all would work out well and according to God’s plan.

One day we were able to see a profoundly brighter side to these situations.  Yes, the medical helicopter is sent out in serious circumstances.  But the mere fact that it is in transit implies that help is on the way.

Psalm 46:1 reminds us that “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.”  Today, we still pray for the helicopter crew and those receiving their services.  But we also offer thanks that God is present, providing strength and comfort to each person.


With an all-encompassing dread, I feared making mistakes.  When I inadvertently did something wrong, I kept quiet and hoped no one would find out.

I entered the corporate world in my fifties.  One day, a mistake was made on the job, and my boss prepared to inform the offender that mistakes would not be tolerated.  With a knot in my stomach, I took a deep breath, interrupted the conversation, and confessed, “It was my fault.  I didn’t provide the correct information.”  Silence filled the room.  My boss looked at me in disbelief.  At first, I braced for the tirade to come; but then I felt my stomach ease.  Admitting my error had brought peace to my spirit.

Confession gives us peace and returns us to a right relationship with the Lord.  The sooner we confess our sins, the less time we spend with a wall standing between us and God.  Not admitting our mistakes creates walls in our personal relationships as well.  The people we wrong may never realize that we are at fault, but our fear of being found out can destroy the friendship.  Restoration with God and with other people begins with confession.  Freedom comes when we admit our imperfections.


Many years ago, my grandmother was riding in a canoe through the wilds of the northern Canadian woods.  Her guide was an old native man who was paddling her to a remote resort.  Dusk was falling, and she had noticed earlier that he had cataracts.  A little anxious, she asked if he needed any help in seeing the shoreline.  Smiling, the guide replied, “No, but thank you.  I learned some time ago to go as far as I can see and when I get there, I can see that much farther.”

I heard that story many years ago when I was a young man.  However, it really didn’t resonate with me until recently.

My wife is now struggling (and fighting bravely) against lung cancer.  For the past five years, the disease has been present and active.  Terrific medical people have helped — with chemotherapy and radiation — but the disease is still there.

Her fight — and mine — is to let her treatments take us as far as we can see and then to go on with new vision and new resolve, coping with what the next day brings.  Our comfort is that we are not alone!  Jesus, the light of the world, is with us.


One of the unfortunate effects of aging is the inability to read without glasses.  My husband and I have purchased several pairs of magnifying eyeglasses and placed them strategically throughout the house so that we can see the words in the phone book, in the newspaper, or on the computer.  Without magnification, words on a page are a blur and we are unable to decipher the information we need.

After Jesus’ death, his disciples’ vision was limited.  They had relied on Jesus to lead them and to show them how the scriptures were fulfilled in him.  While they knew their mission was to carry on his teachings, without Jesus to light their way their vision was clouded by doubt and confusion.  When God sent the Holy Spirit, they were able to see with clarity the promises of scripture.  God will do the same for us.  Receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit can magnify the solutions to our problems and show us the way.


Offensive words — big, stark, and depressing — had been scrawled on the wall of the building.  Someone came along with a can of paint and painted over the words.  The result was a clean, attractive wall.

I had inscribed across my life words, behaviors, and attitudes that were offensive to God.  They often appeared in my mind, especially when I began to seek God.  How could God, who is righteous, accept me with all the moral and spiritual graffiti polluting my life?

Then I heard about Jesus Christ and the cross.  Jesus saw the slate of my failures and offenses and paid the penalty for them.  He not only forgave my sins, but also wiped my heart clean.  By faith in Christ as my Lord and Savior, I have a new beginning, a new destiny.  Calvary is the sign of sin’s defeat.  Before the Lord, we are clean.


One evening, I was out for a run.  I inhaled the cold, crisp winter air, chilling my whole body.  My stopping point was visible between the rays of the setting sun; but my leg muscles burned, and my heart pounded.  I have to push on!  I reminded myself.  The thought of stopping crossed my mind, but I was determined to finish.

At times in a physical race, runners may feel that they have no strength to continue.  Often, athletes keep pace with other people and fix their eyes on a distant object that represents the goal.  This can be true for our spiritual quest as well.  God blesses us with people close to us who help us to keep the faith.  We look to the Lord, who promises to give us the strength to push on until we reach our destination.

Pushing on toward the goal of life in Christ makes our life’s run worth every step taken.  But for now, we can pray as Paul prayed, “holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain” (Phil. 2:16, KJV).


I was at the nursing home visiting my mother when an elderly man stopped to talk to me.  He told me that he was one of nine children and that in the last years of his father’s life, his father had become blind.  “You know,” said the man, “even though he was blind, he knew each of us children by our voices.”  Blindness was not an obstacle to knowing and loving his children.

In the same way, Jesus told us, “I know my own and my own know me”  (John 10:14).  And in Romans 8, Paul reminds us that nothing can prevent us from having a relationship with Jesus Christ if we accept and get to know him.

Blindness could not prevent the elderly man’s father from knowing him.  How good it is to know that no obstacle can prevent us from having a relationship with our heavenly Father!


We all make plans.  We plan for the holidays, for a place to live, for our jobs, for our children, for our retirement.  But life is uncertain.  We don’t actually know what will happen tomorrow.  Trips are cancelled due to bad weather, holiday celebrations postponed because of illness.  We can only plan so much for our children; then they make their own choices.  We try to cushion ourselves against life’s uncertainties.  We buy insurance for our health, cars, and houses.  We plan and save for retirement.

Jesus told a story about a farmer who made plans.  He built barns to store his grain and planned to enjoy a life of ease.  But the farmer did not live to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  Jesus concluded the parable: “So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God” (Luke 12:21).  Christians see more to life than insuring ourselves against disaster.  We plan to be rich in things that matter to God rather than in material possessions.


When my husband left me with three children and a mortgage, I thought my life was close to impossible to bear.  I never had enough time, money, or help to get through the day.  I struggled not to feel sorry for myself, especially when it seemed as if everyone around me had a wonderful life.  Then one day I read about someone who practiced thinking of three things to be thankful for at the end of each day.  I decided to try it.

At first, I could think only of simple things — like being thankful for electricity and hot water for showers.  Then I realized that I had always taken those things for granted and that I really should be thankful for them.  As I continued this daily practice, it became easier; I began to notice more and more things to be thankful for.  I learned to be thankful for a phone call from a friend, the smell and beauty of a freshly mown lawn, the sound of my children laughing, and dinner on the table in the evening.  This gratitude has helped me to realize how many blessings God gives us every day that we seldom take the time to notice.  In turn, my gratitude has made my burdens easier to bear.


During a recent flight aboard a private plane, I sat in the co-pilot’s seat.  Five minutes into the trip, the pilot made a sharp left turn and began descending.  The air-traffic controller had informed him that another aircraft was heading in our direction.  This experience reminded me that the need to change direction is also part of our earthly journey, at times to steer us away from a dead-end path to one that is life-giving.

In the Bible we see this repeatedly.  Having observed and listened to Jesus, the tax collector Zaccheus realized that he wanted to know more.  He invited Jesus into his home, and that encounter changed Zaccheus.  He declared a new approach to how he dealt with people, saying, “Half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.”  Jesus also spoke to Nicodemus (see John 3) and to the woman at the well (see John 4) about changing their direction.

This still happens today.  Through family members, friends, pastors, and even strangers, God continues to call us in new directions.  And as we pray, listen, and obey, we can trust that God will guide us on our journey through new territory.


My brother-in-law had quit a job he had held for more than 20 years and was looking for another one.  I told him I would pray for him, but he told me not to “bother” God, who had bigger problems to take care of.  I told him that God yearns to be “bothered.”  God wants us pray about anything — not just the big stuff, but all the stuff.

I’m thankful that “too busy” or “that’s not important enough for me to deal with” aren’t among God’s responses.  Imagine God saying, “Can we reschedule that for next week?  And instead of an hour, I can give you only 30 minutes — things are a bit hectic, what with the wars and the economic crises.”

Do you think God is more apt to listen to the prayers of church leaders, the president, or world dignitaries because of who they are or the magnitude of their problems or responsibilities? Acts 10:34 says God “does not show favoritism.”  No matter where we stand on the metaphorical ladder of importance, God listens to all of us with the same passion and concern and love.

You and I always have a standing appointment with God.  So we can go ahead and tell God what’s on our mind.  We can “bother” God, who’s always waiting to hear from us.


All of my life I have loved trees.  As a young girl, I would climb up into them, often with a favorite book in hand.  I sat happily among the canopy of leaves — my own special hiding place.  Later, their cool shade on a hot summer day offered the perfect spot for picnics with my daughters.  But more than these wonderful blessings, trees have been a source of inspiration to me and a reminder of God’s loving providence.

As a biologist, I understand the importance of trees for the wellbeing of all living things.  What miracles of creation they are!  Trees provide us with delicious fruits, fragrant flowers, life-saving medicines, and the air that we breathe.  Scientists refer to trees as the “lungs of the earth” because trees take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, giving us life.  In the new heaven and new earth described in scripture, the tree of life stands near the throne of God and “the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations” (Rev. 22:2).

When I read God’s word and look out my window, to me trees symbolize God’s majesty, wisdom, and steadfast love.  I am grateful for this gift that God created just for me .  .  .  and for you.


It is early morning, and I am walking along the shores of beautiful Lake Macquarie.  I can easily imagine the scene described in today’s reading and perhaps include myself in the picture.  The tired and disappointed disciples have been met and fed by their risen Lord.  Then, as they sat around, Jesus addressed Peter for the first time since Peter denied him.  “Peter, do you love me?” Jesus asked.  In reply Peter affirmed his love.  Jesus’ next words became Peter’s motivating commission from that time on: “Feed my sheep.”

In reality our Lord was saying, “If you really love me, prove it by doing what I need you to do:  Help others to love me and encourage them on their journey.”  Jesus’ statement reminds me of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady expressing her frustration by singing, “Don’t talk of love lasting through time.  .  .  .  Show me now!” Based on how we sometimes behave, Jesus could say the same words to us: “Don’t just tell me you love me, show me.  Show me by your love in daily life and relationships.”  When we live close to Christ and allow him to nourish us, others can see the evidence of our love.


My daughter-in-law, Megan, grew up with a dog named Buddy, who was kept outside on a cable run between two shade trees.  Daily he was released for a taste of freedom.  If only Buddy had recognized that he was free!  Although he was released from his cable, he continued to run back and forth between the two trees as if nothing had changed.

When I glance in the mirror, I sometimes catch a glimpse of Buddy.  It’s not a wet snout or scruffy hair that catches my eye but a similar refusal to enjoy the freedom that’s been provided for me.  Divorced twice by the age of 27 and with two little boys in tow, I was overwhelmed by feelings of shame and condemnation.  I kept running back and forth between my past mistakes, as if confined by a cable that kept me from moving beyond that small area.

But when I read and truly believed Romans 8:1, I began to appreciate the freedom Christ has provided for me.  I memorized the verse and spoke it aloud every time shame or condemnation tugged at my heart.  I now choose to believe God’s truth:  No matter how we feel, we are free to move beyond our mistakes.  We can run in the unlimited freedom of God’s truth, confident of God’s love and acceptance.


During my summer vacations I work as a leader and trainer for an indoor challenge-and-fitness center.  Sunday school classes and birthday parties are held at the center, where participants enjoy rope climbing, obstacle courses, and other competitions.  When I first meet my assigned groups and explain the rules, I try to exhibit excitement in order to get them ready for the games.  I always shout in an animated voice, “Raise your hand if you’re ready for some fun!”  Usually only one or two people raise their hands.  I tell them, “Well then, fun will come to you!” The difference is that for those who raised their hands, enjoyment starts immediately; the others have to wait.

People are often bogged down with the cares of life and have difficulty rejoicing.  Paul told his readers that someday they’d be redeemed and ushered into God’s kingdom.  But why wait until then to rejoice?  He invites us to begin rejoicing now.


Several years ago, people from the former Soviet republics had to register in Russia or apply for citizenship.  The department accepted applications two days a week for three hours.  To be received at the 9:00 a.m. session, people started standing in line at 5:00 a.m., and even then sometimes they did not make it to the front of the line.

On the day I was registering, I discovered that to avoid arguments those who were on their second day of waiting had compiled a list to show who was next.  However, periodically, the head of the department came out and destroyed the list in an angry frenzy.  Then the line was thrown into disarray.

This situation reminded me of the passage above when Pharaoh laid heavier work on the Hebrew people by requiring them to go out and gather their own straw.  I sensed the same disdain in the actions of the department head.  Anger and indignation flooded up in me.  But I kept repeating to myself that God would take care of me.  Pharaoh oppressed the people of Israel, but God made them a chosen people.  Often people who have power can make our lives difficult.  But how wonderful that God is with us!


A number of years ago, I had a heart attack. My doctors performed a bypass operation and then prescribed medication and an exercise regimen. They also suggested I participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program. After a few weeks the doctors told me to continue an exercise program.  They also told me that with regular exercise and proper care, I could expect to have good health.

As I thought about what the doctors had prescribed for me — medication and exercise — I realized that I need regular “exercise” to maintain my spiritual health as well.

The apostle Peter was afraid that recently converted Christians would return to their old ways and stumble in their discipleship.  Often, we too can lose enthusiasm for our faith and fall back to our old, lethargic ways.  When such times come upon us, the Bible can be a valuable resource to hold us steady and reorient us to the way of Christ.  Having a program of daily devotions, such as reading The Upper Room and studying the Bible, can keep us from stumbling and move us on toward the abundant life Jesus promised.


In our reading for today, Jesus tells of a man who hired different workers at different times of the day: morning, noon, and evening.  When it was time for the workers to receive the wages promised to them, those who had worked all day were upset that those who came later were paid just as much as they.  The employer told them he had done no wrong, that he paid each one what he had promised.

So what caused these all-day workers to be upset?  They compared their situations to someone else’s.  If they had not compared, they would not have been dissatisfied.

Sometimes, looking at others’ lives, I become dissatisfied because theirs look richer and fuller than mine.  Maybe they have the kinds of relationships that I long for.  Or maybe they have luxuries that seem unattainable to me.  When we compare ourselves to someone else, we may end up feeling better than that person, which can fill us with pride; or we may end up feeling worse, which can fill us with insecurity and jealousy.

The parable we read today teaches us that focusing on what others have or do not have leaves us feeling empty.  If we focus instead on the goodness of God and how trustworthy and wonderful God is, we will find that the spiritual life offers riches beyond comparison.


When our son was around six years old, he would sometimes stop as we made our way home from our shop, saying, “Dad, I’m too tired to walk.”  I would answer, “Then you can run a little.”  That was one of those typical illogical answers that a child sometimes gets from an adult.  To be honest, I said it in order to distract him.  But to my surprise he restored his energy by changing pace, and he was not tired anymore.

We all can sometimes lose our energy simply because we get stuck at a certain pace.  We form our lives in certain routines, doing business as usual.  That’s why I admire the paralytic in this story from Mark’s Gospel.  When Jesus told him to stand up and walk, he had the courage to do so.  Jesus asked him not only to change pace but to do something he certainly was not used to doing.

Persevering in the faith requires us to be willing to listen to God’s voice calling us to change our routines, to do something we have not done before, and to enter areas we could never have imagined.  Such a change of pace takes courage.  But “the one who calls you is faithful” and will give us the grace we need to change (1 Thess. 5:24).


I grew up on a farm around many different animals.  By far the most labor-intensive of these were the sheep.  Caring for the sheep required much more work than taking care of our cattle. The sheep had to be checked on every day.  Individual sheep would wander away from the flock and get lost, and lambs would get separated from their mothers.  Whenever this happened there would be loud and plaintive bleating from the sheep, which would end only when one of us went to the field and brought the wandering sheep back to the flock.  I have many memories of my parents pouring out feed for the sheep and then counting them to make sure that all were safe.

Whenever I hear Jesus described as a shepherd, I smile.  We humans are like those difficult, wandering sheep — the ones who need so much care and tending, the ones who get lost so easily and need to be rounded up and brought back by a caring shepherd.  How patient and kind shepherds have to be!  But isn’t that how Christ is with us, always willing to seek us and bring us back to the fold?  When we stray and get lost, Christ loves us enough to look for us and bring us home.


My mother died a few days after my fourth birthday.  The only knowledge I have of her comes from stories my family tells.

When I was a teenager, my dad handed me an envelope.  Inside was a letter Mother had written to me before she passed away.  I read her handwritten note:  “I want to tell you how very much I love you and how I wanted and waited for you.  You probably won’t remember too much about me as the years go by, but I want you to grow into a fine young man, to be always mindful of God, and to ask for God’s direction.  Remember your mother loved you with all her heart and will always be with you in spirit.”

To be loved by someone I don’t remember is a strange, wonderful feeling.  Actually, we all can know what it feels like.  My mother’s love is but a reflection of the love of God, our parent, who has yearned for us from the beginning of time.

The Bible is a letter from God to us, reminding us of the love that mysteriously embraces us until we see God face to face.  As Jesus said, “Remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matt. 28:20).


During my college days I was zealous in my studies and my attempts to find work.  Yet my spirit felt hungry and dry.  While believing that being employed by a first-rate company would bring me happiness, I also had other questions: What is the purpose of my existence? What meaning is there in my giving myself to this work?  Life is limited to one time; therefore, I wanted to devote my life to something with real value.

I knew there should be something more important for me to learn, and I have always sought that true teaching.  Then I encountered the words of Jesus in the Bible.  Jesus offered me water that satisfies my spiritual thirst and became “a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.”  Before, I had seen God as distant from me.  Now, I have a very close relationship, like a father and daughter.

Now that nagging uneasiness is gone.  My heart is content.  I worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23), and I am enveloped in God’s love.  I give heartfelt thanks to God who shines in my heart and displaces the darkness of the world with the light of Christ.


I’ve always loved the parable of the lost son because it is a great illustration of God’s limitless grace, mercy, and forgiveness.  However, while many see this as a parable about the younger son, the story begins, “There was a man who had two sons.”  When I first read this story, I felt sympathy for the older son, who obeyed his father, worked hard, and did the right things.  We can understand why he was upset about the party his father gave in honor of his selfish, immature younger brother.

I have come to see in the older brother sins of the heart — jealousy, self-righteousness, resentment, and judgment.  These might not be as obvious as the outward sins of the younger brother, but they can be just as dangerous, especially since we tend to overlook them in ourselves.

The parable is a great message of love, forgiveness, and grace toward the younger son.  But actually its message about the older son is just as important. Jesus said earlier in the book of Luke: “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.  Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”  These are great words to live by.


The Christian ministry where I work serves those in need by giving food and clothing and meeting other basic needs. One Saturday as my husband and I were on our way to a business associate’s company picnic, my cell phone rang.  One of my clients told me, weeping, that she had absolutely nothing to feed her children.

My first reaction was, This is my day off, and I want to enjoy it with my husband.  But then the Lord reminded me I am a Christian all the time, not just when it is convenient.  I jotted down the woman’s address, and we headed to the food pantry.  We also stopped by our house to get some meat for the family.

When we arrived at the client’s home, two of her children ran out to greet us with loving hugs.  As we brought sacks of groceries into the kitchen, the young mother stood crying and gave both of us a thank-you hug as well.

Sometimes I am tempted not to respond to a call from God that is inconvenient or unpleasant.  But then the Lord reminds me to take up my cross and follow Jesus — 24/7.


I was driving to one of our firm’s subsidiaries.  It is quite a distance away, but traffic was light.  While crossing a bridge, I noticed a significant difference between the landscape behind me and the one I was approaching.  The vegetation ahead was richer than that behind me and featured a riot of colors in hues of green and yellow.

Until this point in the trip, I had been churning inside as I thought about my work performance.  My company expected better results; and as much as I tried, my efforts did not match their expectations.  Now, as I crossed the bridge, I remembered that God always accompanies us as we traverse troubled waters. As I reflected more on this, my spirit lifted quickly.  I felt invigorated, as if I had taken in a breath of fresh air.  I thanked God for standing by me during the difficult times and guiding me to a place of peace.


The Lord has blessed me, enabling me to be a wife, a mom, and a grandmother.  However, I have struggled from time to time with low self-esteem. Because I do not have a college education or a career outside my home, sometimes I see myself as not having anything to offer the world.  Other people have so much more to offer, it seems.

Recently, as I read Jeremiah 9:23-24, I experienced an epiphany; I grasped a new perspective on how we should evaluate ourselves. God said we are not to boast in the wisdom we possess, the strength we have, or the riches we’ve accumulated. Our education and whatever career or job we have are included as part of our wisdom and possessions.  Just as we are not to boast, we also are not to be ashamed for our lack of a college education or a high-status job or career.  If our value to the body of Christ could be measured, it should be measured according to our service to others.


We have a new puppy, a Labrador retriever named Holly.  We spend a lot of time swinging in the hammock while Holly explores the back yard in the comfort of our presence.  If playing on the deck, she often will move close to our legs and eventually sit on someone’s foot as she chews on her bone.  If we move while she is out on the lawn playing, she stops immediately and checks for our new location.  Our presence gives her the confidence to explore.

Holly’s behavior reminds me of my relationship to God.  I explore life — sometimes without any thought of God’s presence.  But often, especially when life throws a challenge my way, I need the comfort of God’s touch; I need to know that God is close by and that I matter.  I need to know that God is working diligently for good in all situations in my life.

God’s touch may come through a hug from another person, through something that I read in the Bible, or through a timely devotion in The Upper Room.  Sometimes I sense God’s touch in the still, small voice that occasionally comes when I least expect it — but I sense its message with startling clarity.  In whatever form it comes, that touch gives my life warmth and color and fills me with confidence that through God’s power at work in me I can do all that God asks of me.


Hours after the Last Supper, the disciples were put to the test — and they failed.  They abandoned Jesus when the soldiers came, denied they knew him, and mostly hid while he died on the cross.  They were so cowardly that they did what we probably would have done, perhaps what anyone with common sense would have done.

The story must have seemed familiar to people living in Israel during Roman times.  Others had claimed to be the messiah and were executed by the authorities as their followers scattered.  But this time the story had a different ending.  This time, those who had fled came back to proclaim more loudly than ever that the executed man was really the Savior.  Something had profoundly changed the followers since the night they forsook their leader.  What was it?  They had seen the risen Lord.

These failed followers had bickered among themselves over places of honor, had misunderstood Jesus, and had tried to tempt him to the easy way.  But then the Holy Spirit descended upon these former cowards in flames.  And these all-too-human followers boldly spoke in dozens of tongues to tell Good News.  The disciples had become the Church.  We call it Pentecost.


My granddaughters were to compete in classical ballet.  However, before the ballet, we were told that a troupe of five-year-old girls would perform individually.  Four girls came on stage, one after the other.  Then came the turn of Number 5.  The music for the dance was “Me and My Teddy Bear.”  But no little girl appeared.  Instead we heard her crying.  

Later in the program all the dancers lined up on stage.  To our delight, each little girl was given a medal on a ribbon, including Number 5, who, pale and tear-stained, was clutching her teddy bear.  We saw no tears now but instead a watery smile.

That’s like grace, I thought.  We don’t have to perform; we don’t have to earn God’s approval.  Grace is the unmerited love of God.  It’s sheer gift, a free expression of God’s love for us.


Friends told me that my sudden illness was an allergic reaction, but I didn’t really believe them because I’d never had allergies.  Finally, with a high fever and barely able to move, I begged my wife to take me to the hospital.  I remember saying, “I guess I must have some sort of allergy.”

The hospital staff isolated the problem and took corrective measures that relieved my physical distress.  Later it struck me that until I admitted my problem, little could be done to save me from it.  I had to be open to the remedy for my condition.

Something similar is true for us as sinners.  Until we admit that we have sinned, we can never open our hearts to accept God’s forgiving grace that is the remedy for sin.  I heard a minister say one time, “The hardest step in the act of redemption is the step where the sinner accepts the need for it.”  Only after we admit that we are sinners can we accept God’s grace offered as a remedy for our sinfulness.


Recently I was with some friends discussing our understanding of God.  One person always referred to God using the phrase, “the God I don’t understand.”  Another said she was truly glad there was mystery involved with understanding God.  The third person said he had been searching everywhere for God and in every way possible, but he could not find God. Therefore, he decided to quit the search and let God find him.  Then he added, “It worked!”

Listening to these comments made me think of Thomas’ experience of questioning and seeking.  And then I remembered the father who had asked for his son to be healed and how he answered Jesus by saying, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”

At times I am like each one in my group of friends, and sometimes I am like the people I read about in scripture.  I find comfort in knowing that people in the Bible grappled with the same feelings and challenges we experience today.  God always knows where we are.  When we are still (see Ps. 46:10) and make ourselves available to God, we are saying, “Here I am, God.  Find me!”  At times, I see God’s presence revealed through other people or even through nature (such as when a butterfly lights on my hand and stays there).  I am grateful for the mystery of the God I don’t fully understand.  And I’m equally grateful that when I cannot find God, I know that God can and will find me.


A pastor of mine once said, “The Christians of one generation tend to become the Pharisees of the next.”  The Pharisees had started out on the right track; they wanted to live for God.  But keeping the law became an end in itself.  They forgot that the law was meant to draw them closer to God.

Today’s reading shows what happens when our focus on outward cleanliness becomes an obsession, blocking out the more important part of the inner life.  Jesus’ words cause us to step back and look carefully at what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.  The three “woes” in today’s reading remind us not to focus on appearances while the inner life is in disrepair.

The first tells us that if we love God, we will desire justice and give to the poor.  Then Jesus says that if we are humble, we will not care about having the “important” seats.  Finally, if we neglect the inner life, Jesus tells us, we will become like an unmarked grave, trampled underfoot.  But if we nurture it, we will be vital and spiritually alive.


On Good Friday, John stood at the cross beside Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Together they faced what was surely the worst day of their lives, as the man they loved suffered and died.  We next read of John’s racing to the empty tomb on Sunday.  But where had he been on Saturday?  Did he try to comfort Mary and to deal with his own brokenness?  Did he spend time with the other disciples as they struggled to make sense of recent events?  Did he go for a long walk, reliving the past days?  If only we could have reassured him, “Hang on, John; resurrection is coming.  Things will get better.”  But he probably wouldn’t have believed us.

One of the worst days of my life came when I received my cancer diagnosis.  People told me, “It will get better”; but I didn’t believe them.  Years later, I have a ministry to hurting people, and I’m a published author.  Yes, my life got better.  But I didn’t believe it would when people told me.

Loss and death come to all of us.  When we are broken and confused, the future seems messy.  When that’s our situation, we can hang on in assurance that resurrection is coming.  God says so.


In my area, the month of June kicks off the season of triathlon racing.  These contests of varying distances include swimming, biking, and running and are held one after the other.  Over the last five years I have competed in triathlons and will participate again this year.

In order to complete a triathlon, an athlete needs to prepare for it.  Workouts that balance all three areas are better for the body and more helpful in completing the races than are workouts that focus on just one area.

A spiritual journey is a lot like a triathlon.  To fully engage in the spiritual journey we need balance in prayer, Bible study, and worship.  These three activities will strengthen our spiritual lives so that we can accomplish what the writer of Hebrews calls “the race marked out for us.”  Some might add a fourth area — service.  But I am a firm believer that service is actually an outward expression of prayer, Bible study, and worship.

When we train by praying, reading the Bible, and worshiping with others, we can persevere in the race marked out for us, the race that leads to an experience of God that is eternal.


As the outdoor, Easter sunrise service began, I noticed a hot-air balloon lying limp on the ground.  When the minister started the sermon, someone began to pump hot air into the balloon. Soon it expanded into brilliant color, ready to rise, symbolizing the risen Christ.

Watching the balloon, I reflected on my past and realized that my life had once been like that empty balloon.  When our children were grown, I stopped attending church.  As time passed, I sensed something was missing in my day-to-day existence.  I felt unfulfilled.  When I made the decision to worship again, my life began to change.  The spirit of God flooded into my being.

My spiritual journey took me to Bible studies and on mission trips.  Participating in small study groups gave me the opportunity to grow and learn from other church members. My days took on new meaning and purpose.  Like that once-empty balloon, my once-empty life is now filled — with the grace, love, and strength of God.


I winced, gritted my teeth, and muttered under my breath.  The car rattled and rocked.  I had hit yet another pothole on my way to work.  The holes varied in depth as well as width.  Some were avoidable; some were not.  Signs warned drivers about some of them; new ones caught me by surprise time and time again.

Angry after another jolting journey home, I reached for pen and paper, ready to vent my fury via a letter to the local newspaper.  With pen poised, I paused.  Although the potholes are a problem that needs to be addressed, God revealed to me the true cause of my anger: My son was experiencing a difficult time, and I felt helpless.  I could do nothing but sit back, watch, and pray. I returned the pen and paper to the drawer, my agitation having subsided.

Knowing Christ doesn’t guarantee a completely smooth ride, but with him we can endure life’s uneven road. He endured a much harder road to the cross.  Because of that great love, he will guide us through our journey and provide us with what we need to reach our destination.


When I was 16, I was told that before I was born my grandfather had spent a year in a mental hospital.  Grandpa had always seemed a bit odd to me, but I never thought he was mentally ill.

When I asked my dad why he had not told me this earlier, his response revealed something important about love.  He acknowledged that his father was mentally ill and that the disease had caused much pain. But he had not told me about the illness.  He did not want me to judge or be frightened of my grandfather.  He wanted me to love his dad as my grandfather, as he had loved him as his dad.

The fourth commandment tells us to honor our father and mother and follows with the promise: “that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.”  Twenty-five years have passed since I learned about my grandfather, and I have kept that moment alive as a testament to what loving and honoring a parent means.  I saw in my dad a testament to the love of God, who loves us no matter what our circumstances, diagnoses, or past acts.


Recently I went for a nostalgic drive through my old neighborhood and was shocked to find that I hardly recognized it.  The landmarks I remembered were no longer there, and soon I was hopelessly lost.

Life in the 21st century is a bit like that. Many landmarks that guided us are no longer here. We find ourselves feeling ill at ease in a world where boundaries are few and ideas about morality have changed, leaving us often in confusion.

In earlier times, navigators at sea plotted their course according to certain, fixed points — a star, a headland, or some other permanent feature.  As Christians, we also have such reference points.  Our God is unchanging throughout the millennia, and the Bible provides eternal truth that will outlast all fads and philosophies. God’s truths provide the only reference we need to guide us through life.  And we are entrusted with the holy task of teaching these truths to others.


As a boy, I mastered the art of catching fish bait.  First, I had to find a patch of tall grass.  Then I walked systematically through the grass, with one foot sweeping forward in a slow scythe-like motion.  Scared crickets would leap, at which point I would crouch, cup one hand, and pounce.

Somewhere along the line, I lost my passion for catching crickets — and on a much larger scale, for mastering new things.  From fear of failure or disapproval, I now stay safely in my comfort zone. In fact, as an adult, I live more like a cricket than a person, hiding and leaping in fear.

Throughout the Gospels, Jesus says, “Fear not.” He appreciates faith-driven courage and boldness, such as that of the paralytic’s friends (in Luke, chapter five).  In 2 Timothy, Paul reminds Timothy to rekindle the gift of God that was in him.  Although Timothy was loyal and dependable, he apparently struggled with being timid, just as I do.  Paul urged him to remember that God’s power was at work in him.  In times when I feel small and scared, like a cricket, it’s comforting to know that God’s powerful Spirit is also in me, encouraging me, “Take heart!  I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).


No one on earth is insignificant.  God created each of us unique.  We have distinct fingerprints, voiceprints, eye prints, and DNA.  No one has ever been exactly like you; nor will anyone in the future ever be exactly like you.  Although your descendants will carry parts of your DNA, none will be like you.

Our Creator makes salvation and relationship with us personal.  God even knows the number of hairs on our head.  Your name and mine are engraved on the palm of God’s hand.  (See Isa. 49:16.)  Even if a mother could forget her child, God will never forget us.  (See Isa. 49:15.)  God makes a covenant with each of us — a binding agreement; God loves us even before we decide to love God.

God’s Son, Jesus, died on the cross for you and for me.  We are important to God.  Throughout the Bible we read that God cares about individuals — the one lost sheep (Luke 15), the Samaritan woman despised by her own people (John 4), the widow whose only son had died (Luke 7), and many more.  God doesn’t ask us to be great by human standards.  All we are asked to do is to love God in the ways we can.


It’s 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and I’m awake.  Really, God?

A group from the church would be leaving at 6 to go to the homeless mission to cook and serve breakfast.  On Thursday I had told the preacher that I had plans for Saturday.  Never mind that my planned activity did not begin until 10 and that we would be done serving by then.  Haven’t I already helped several times this year?  Other people need to take a turn.

All these thoughts and more ran through my head.  I tried to make up excuses.  But since I was wide awake, I felt that God wanted me to go. I would never wake up this early on a Saturday — normally.  Despite feeling guilty for resisting God’s nudge, I was still lying in bed.  Then I realized that whether I went or not, God would not love me any more or any less.  My salvation would not be any less secure.  This assurance got me out of bed with joy in my heart and a desire to serve.

Cooking and serving breakfast to hungry people and working alongside my brothers and sisters were blessings.  God didn’t wake me to do a task; God woke me to give me a blessing.


I was traveling to church by bus one Sunday morning wearing my best church clothes and holding my Bible.  The conductor bumped my head twice as he was giving change to another passenger.  I wanted to shout at him in the strongest terms, but something restrained my tongue.  I noticed his eyes were bloodshot, and I could smell alcohol on his breath.

For the moment I kept quiet, and I am glad I did.  The conductor looked at me and said, “You are going to church, yah?  Please pray for me that I can change.  I want to change.”  I asked him his name, and I talked with him about the love of God.  Then I prayed for him when I got off the bus.

Would I have had a chance to talk with him about God if I had scolded him or argued?  I doubt it.  How we choose to respond in daily situations can be a light to those around us.  I thought about Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:16, “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.”

What we do or say can lead people toward God or away from God.  May we choose to serve as God’s lights wherever we see darkness around us.


Once a week, my two-year-old granddaughter and I go on an adventure.  Before we drive to the park or the carousel, I buckle my granddaughter into her car seat.  Last week, as usual, I found the task challenging.  Lifting her into her car seat was awkward.  I struggled to position, adjust, and buckle the shoulder straps and then the lap belt.  The task completed, I looked at my granddaughter — now safe and secure — and let out a deep sigh of relief.  She looked up at me with big blue eyes, smiled, and said, “Good job!”

I was startled that a two-year-old knew those words, more surprised that she knew when to say them.  I felt that my efforts were appreciated and realized that her parents must have been saying, “Good job!” to her as she mastered new skills.  I was pleased that she is learning to be an encourager.

God is the ultimate encourager.  We hear encouragement in God’s words after Jesus’ baptism, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”  We follow God’s example when we appreciate the efforts of others.  Encouragers lift the spirits of struggling people.  As the word implies, encouragers fill us with courage for the next challenge.  We can speak encouragement to people who need to hear that their efforts are appreciated — and that is all of us.


Many years ago, I had the privilege of singing in an excellent church choir.  One year, the director of a college came to give us voice lessons.  I learned that when middle C is struck on the piano, the bones of the inner ear vibrate exactly 256 times per second.

Our ears open to receive the music in and around us.  We think as many as 50,000 thoughts a day.  When we walk, we use about 200 muscles.  The mystery of our birth, the mystery of the love we feel, the mystery of our identity are unfathomable.  Each of us is an incredible example of creation.  We are “fearfully and wonderfully made.”

Everyday life isn’t everyday.  The surface of what we see and hear isn’t all there is.  When we laugh, when we cry, when we feel something happening inside, we open ourselves to the possibilities of seeing God more deeply.  The potential of the life that we have been given is breathtaking — when we pay attention.

The possibilities are endless.  The music of the presence of God is everywhere.  If we open our ears, we can hear it.  Yes, God is near.


For much of the 1990s, Belfast was a scary place to be.  We lived with weekly bombings, shootings, and other constant threats.  My children essentially grew up in a war zone.  People were afraid to talk.  Then I joined an interdenominational group and heard Paul’s message: “Everything has become new!” These were joyful words amid the tension and suspicion around us. And with relationship to Christ comes a task:  the “ministry of reconciliation.”

As part of our mission, I quietly attended both Catholic and Protestant churches.  I discovered ways of meeting people with even more diverse religious affiliations and political goals.  This seemed a tiny ministry compared with those who were carrying out important peace negotiations and making groundbreaking public statements.

Later, church people and politicians from all Northern Irish political positions were led by the same hope for peace. A patient commitment from the British, Irish, and American governments kept that hope alive. Many people inside and outside our churches worked together across deep divisions. As we look to God for our hope, peace can thrive.


I saw the doe long before she saw me.  She was nestled on a soft patch of grass, enjoying the peace of the quiet forest.  I didn’t want to disturb her.  She seemed perfectly content where she was.

I felt the peace I saw in that scene.  But the company I worked for was in danger of going out of business, and I faced the prospect of losing my job.  With the unemployment rate high, getting a new job would be no easy task.

But the Bible tells us that stress does not mean we can’t find contentment.  The apostle Paul learned that the way to be content in every circumstance of life is to rely on God and the strength God provides (Phil. 4:12-13).  God enables us to “lie down in green pastures” and restores our souls (Ps. 23:2-3).

I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know that God will be with me every step of the way.  In a world that changes daily, we find peace and contentment in believing the promises of God, who never changes.


Several years ago my son played little-league baseball.  I loved watching the games with the other moms, especially those who were members of the church where I was a pastor.  In the midst of that idyllic time, an event occurred which broke the hearts of everyone in our small town: A star high-school baseball player from one year before was killed in a car accident while at a tournament with his college baseball team.  He was 19 years old.  His older sister, Melinda, was a member of our church.

The next summer as Melinda and I were outside watching baseball again, I asked her as I had often that year, “How are you getting through this?” She answered, “By God’s grace.  I know people are praying for me.  When people send me notes or cards, when they telephone to see how I’m doing, I know their love and concern for me are answers to my prayers and pleas for support.”

We all know someone who is going through a difficult time — the loss of a job, sickness, or the death of a loved one. In those situations, do we sometimes look too hard for God’s presence?  Do we expect answers to prayer always to be dramatic?  God works through acts as simple as a phone call from a friend.  You and I can be the answer to someone’s prayer for help and comfort.


Several times I have heard Christians say to others whose attitude or behavior they considered wrong: “You will not be saved.”  Such statements bother me, particularly when addressed to someone in response to his or her ideas or questions about faith.  I think no believer should judge the faithfulness or religious sensibility of others — the way they read the Bible, the way they pray, whether or not they go to church.

Scripture teaches that God, not humans, will decide who enters the kingdom.  While it is up to us to witness to our faith in Christ through our behavior, it is not ours to judge what’s in another’s heart.  Only God can do that.

We aspire to salvation, to eternal life, but the only one who can give it to us is the Lord, because “for mortals [salvation] is impossible.”  But “everything is possible for God.”  And God offers salvation to all.


We live next to a river, and across from our house three strong trees grow on the riverbank.  In the evening I like to watch as flocks of ibis, cormorants, and other birds come to the trees to rest for the night.  At times I have counted more than 60 birds flying into those trees, and yet when they are settled, not one bird can be seen.  The trees offer a safe place for the night.

Like those birds, we often need a safe place — some shelter during the storms that life inevitably brings.  We need a place to hide when we feel weary and worn.  Just as those trees are safe resting places for the birds, so is God a refuge for me and for you, always there, a “hiding place.”  In God’s sheltering presence we are refreshed and restored as we pray and read the Bible.

When I look at those trees, I remember that God is always present for me — offering safety, rest, comfort, and refreshment.  And I am grateful.


My four-year-old twin daughters and I were at the circus.  At times the arena would go dark and a single spotlight would shine on the ringmaster.  He was dressed in vibrant, flowing clothes with an extra-large hat.  His voice boomed as he called attention to himself and to the next act.

The image of this ringmaster made me think of another Master.  But this master, Jesus, was different.  He did not stand on a box and wave his arms and shout, “Gather ‘round and see the miraculous.  First, someone confirm that this man is really blind.  Now, watch and be amazed!”  Instead, Jesus simply asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?”

Jesus’ miracles were usually focused on helping someone.  His miracles impress me not so much because of their display of power but because they reveal Jesus’ caring heart.  Multiplying fish and bread is quite amazing, but what really draws me to Jesus is that he noticed when people were tired and hungry and did something about it.  Jesus did miracles because he cared.


When Moses was called by God, Moses’ first response was, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” (Exod. 3:11, NIV).  God then countered all of Moses’ objections about his mission.  God gave him power to perform miracles and promised to go with him and teach him what to say.  Moses still was not willing and wanted somebody else to be given that job.  God was angry but then commissioned Aaron to speak for Moses.

My situation was something like Moses’.  A couple of years ago, I was hesitant to take up a new responsibility in the organization.  I had neither academic qualifications nor the experience for the new job.  I felt inadequate and fearful.  At the same time, I sensed that the new assignment was something God wanted me to do.  Gradually my thinking changed.  Instead of considering only my limitations, I started taking into account the help from God that would be available to me.  After taking some time to decide, I agreed to take the new job and prayed for guidance in doing it.  God was faithful and gave me not only wisdom for the task but also power to carry it out.


We were climbing a mountain in Washington’s Cascade Range.  The weather was calm, we were below snow level, and the summit was within sight.  Suddenly, at about 7,500 feet, we encountered a fierce wind that made movement difficult and dangerous.  Clutching our jackets and trying to protect our eyes from blowing debris, my climbing partner (who years later became my wife) and I crawled behind a large boulder.  The rock offered protection until we could resume our climb to the summit, where the air was clear and calm.

Our lives often follow a similar course. Challenges and uncertainty may suddenly arise, frustrating our plans and disrupting our journey.  Unemployment, loneliness, and illness may confront us when we feel least able to cope.  However, when difficulties and peril surround us, we can take shelter in the rock that is the Lord, knowing God hears our prayers and offers refuge for us both on this earth and for eternity.


Gardening is my husband’s favorite hobby.  He especially loves bringing home sick or dying plants that his co-workers have thrown away.  He nurtures them by giving one extra water, another fertilizer.  He trims off diseased leaves. Over time, he carefully restores these withered brown plants to life.  Sometimes they even surprise us with blooms.

I used to grumble about the ugly plants cluttering our windowsill.  Then one day as I watched my husband working with these sick and dying plants, I saw instead Christ’s hands gently caring for me.

I was broken and sick when Christ took me in.  Many of us are.  But he provides each of us what we need to grow.  He doesn’t care if we are sickly.  He restores us to life, abundant life.  Christ sees the promise in us when no one else does, and through his tender care, we can bloom.


For much of my life as a believer I have heard Jeremiah 29:11 quoted: “ ‘I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future’ ” (NIV).  I have been comforted by the words but have not really thought about the context in which they were expressed.  This was God’s reassurance to people in exile.

Because of the people’s unfaithfulness, they were taken to Babylon, where they would stay for decades.  Then God would bring them back to the Promised Land.

Knowing the context makes this verse even more meaningful to me.  When I sin, discipline may come in the consequences I suffer.  Or I may be “exiled” from the comfort of close relationship with God. But I know God’s faithfulness, and I know that I, like the Israelites, will be brought out of my exile as I recognize my waywardness and return to God.


For many years, the care and supervision of my aging parents has been my responsibility.  Although they live in their own home, I deliver groceries, plan and prepare meals, organize and order medicines, and drive them to doctors’ appointments.  I have put my life on hold and am often not available to my husband or children.  I pray daily for physical strength, wisdom in decision-making, and protection for my family.

One day, feeling overwhelmed, I pleaded with God for help.  Minutes later, I switched on the radio and heard a speaker who seemed to be talking directly to me.  He said, “We all have times when we want to give up.  But I am here to tell you one thing:  God is present in our troubles.  God loves us.  And God offers us strength to persevere.”  In that moment, I was reassured that God had heard my cries and would see me through this phase of my life.

Often God speaks to us through people who give us hope to move forward when the stress of living seems too much.  We are called to honor our parents.  With God’s strong hand on me and by abundant prayer, I will find the support I need to honor them with grace and love.


My Dad was 87 when he died.  He loved God, and he loved people.  I miss the kindness in his eyes and his voice, his gentleness and care.  He made me feel valued and important.

It wasn’t always this way. When I was 30, he apologized to me for showing more attention to my brothers than to me when we were children.  I had felt rejected and unimportant.  Since then, God used my dad in wonderful ways to show me love. He became more attentive to me; he listened well, showing an active interest in my life.  He was caring and kind and corrected me in a very loving way.  I experienced healing and a sense of being greatly valued.  I no longer felt worthless. Through my dad, I came to understand the kindness of Jesus.

Jesus demonstrated great love for people, especially the outcast and unpopular.  He refused to condemn the woman caught in adultery.  He searched out the demon-possessed.  Jesus brought light to the darkness; and he calls us to be people of light who bring healing, love, and acceptance to others.


Late one night, standing on the platform waiting for a subway, I was approached by a homeless man.  With no sign of the train, I turned an ear to hear his story — the same story I had heard from many who live on the streets of our city: drugs, crime, the loss of a loved one, and a life in disarray.  He was just looking for some food.  We had a light moment laughing about our favorite sports teams, and I felt moved to help him.  As the train pulled in, I handed him more money than he might usually see, knowing it was enough to get him into safe, clean lodging around the corner.  He was shocked at the gift, and I was shocked at the phrase that came from my lips: “Let God bless you.”

As the train pulled away, the meaning of that moment hit me.  In that instant, God had brought two paths together — one where a blessing was needed and one where many blessings had already been given.  I am incredibly thankful for the blessings of my life.  But in that moment, I could see that I had been blessed to be a blessing, just as Paul had told the Christians in Corinth.

Faith turns our hearts to God for blessing in our most dire moments.  But that same faith can lead us to approach life with open eyes and open hearts to bless others.


“There are no free lunches!” I often hear this common expression in my daily life.  Because I grew up in a merit-based society, I was taught to work for what I want to achieve.  Study diligently for good grades, work hard for high wages, and dress to impress were some of the expectations set before me.  Yet our Father in heaven offers a totally different standard.  God freely gives us the best gift in this world — God’s Son, Christ Jesus.

People like me, and perhaps like you, who were taught to earn and not merely receive, have a tendency to try to earn everything — including our salvation.  We may think that we need to be good, kind, pleasant, and charitable people.  Yes, we may be good people according to this world’s standard.  But one sin makes us sinners, and so we can never be good enough.  Even so, God loves us and wants to be in relationship with us.  God gave the one Son to make all of us sons and daughters.


When my husband and I moved into our house, we noticed a wonderful garden next door filled with beautiful flowers and wholesome vegetables.  Our neighbor, Herb, was a master gardener.  But more than that, he was generous.  Herb hung a bucket on our side of the fence that separated our back yards.  As he quietly worked in his garden, Herb would fill our bucket with wonderful things.  One day it might be tomatoes; the next day, zucchini.  Another day it was cucumbers; and the day after, fresh beets.  We never saw Herb filling our bucket, but the evidence of his presence was undeniable.

One day as I emptied that bucket, I thought about what would happen if I forgot that it was there or perhaps became too lazy to empty it.  The vegetables would rot and be wasted.

Maybe God is like Herb .  .  .  working quietly in the garden of our lives, filling our “buckets” with gifts and skills for us to use.  Has God given you a gift that you are not using?  When we use what is in our buckets, God can fill them up again.


I am not a frequent flyer, so I was unfamiliar with the “people-mover” contraption at the airport.  Stepping onto the large human-conveyor belt, I relaxed as it carried me across the airport. Then, without warning, the machine stopped. Conversations hushed.  We all stood, waiting to start moving again.  Finally, someone behind me said, “Walk!”  Somehow that idea had not occurred to us.  As the person in front got the message, we all began to move forward again — the old-fashioned way.

Sometimes the church is like that moving sidewalk.  Saved by God’s grace, we find a fellowship of like-minded people.  But sadly many times we do not move forward.  Only as each member exercises his or her gifts can we together make progress, serving the world that Christ died to save.

The urgent mandate of that airport traveler is the same mandate our Savior utters to every Christian.  When we are paralyzed by a status-quo, stand-still mentality, Christ says, “Walk!”


During our annual family trip to the beach, our children were learning to swim in the waves.  We showed them how to jump at the right time and how to turn away from a wave that was too big or that broke at the wrong time.  Most important, we taught them to answer the question, “Are you OK?” After lots of jumps and splashes and a few mouthfuls of ocean, they gained confidence and began to enjoy the water.

As I watched my children play in the surf, I began to see that riding the waves is like steering through life.  Our lives are unpredictable.  The swell that looks menacing from far off may be a mere ripple by the time it arrives.  The wave that passes me by may knock down my neighbor.  We cannot predict the hard or easy times; we cannot be prepared for every eventuality.

Yet I also realize that God sees our struggles and is with us even when the world knocks us down.  No matter how difficult the waters, we are never out of God’s sight.  We can remember the mighty Lord who made the seas we navigate.


The people I work with in the foreign-language department of a university all communicate in English, though not always the same English.  We argue so much about British and American English that I sometimes start to wonder if it is the same language at all.

The other day, instead of wading into the debate, I found myself thinking of Matthew 5:17.  The passage seems straightforward enough: The old laws would stand.  But Jesus might have been saying that he wasn’t as concerned about the law as about people’s actions.

In my work, we get caught up in the interpretation of words and phrases.  What is more important is the substance of the documents.  In our religious lives, we can become engrossed in the small details and nuances of Bible passages.  What is more important is the life we are supposed to live.

Maybe when Jesus talked about fulfilling the law, he was talking about living according to its deeper meaning.  His message of compassion, peace, and understanding and his life show us how to live.

Next time an argument breaks out among my colleagues, I’ll try to bring them back to the importance of what we are writing.  And in my spiritual life, I will spend less time focusing on the nuances of Bible passages.  Instead, I am going to focus on living as Jesus did.


Last year my husband and I took a Bible study class together to incorporate the Bible into our daily lives, to better serve as disciples of Christ.  I was inspired by the story of Moses who came down the mountain after being in God’s presence, unaware that his face was radiant.  How awesome to experience God’s glory so much that others can witness its impact on me just by being in my presence!

As I thought about it, I realized that I have experienced God’s presence.  I’ve seen God’s face in my family members.  I’ve heard God’s voice in words of love and compassion spoken to me in times of stress.  I’ve felt God’s glory while viewing the beauty of the world.  When I look back on my life, I see that God’s hand guided me to become a teacher.

I have experienced God.  So I ask myself, Can others see God reflected in my face, or do I wear a “veil,” hiding God?  I am afraid others too often see a veil.  Realizing this has made me consciously try harder to reflect God’s love to others, including strangers I see in passing.  As we reflect God’s glory, we are being transformed into God’s likeness.


My mother committed suicide when I was six years old.  I found her body.  No one spoke to me about her after her death, so I grew up not knowing her as a whole person.  I remembered her most vividly at her worst moment.

On the fiftieth anniversary of her death, the Lord nudged me to get to know my mother.  In response, I spent six months researching her life and traveling to places where she had lived, studied, and worked.  With the support of my wife, my dad, and many other people, I was able to “meet” my mother.  I learned about her life and how much she loved me.  Instead of a distant, unknown, and traumatic figure, she became my mom.

During this healing process, God showed me that as I strive to see others in the way God views them, I must see beyond their worst moments.  Jesus did not reduce Peter to the lack of faith Peter revealed when he sank beneath the waves or when he denied his Lord.  Instead, Jesus saw Peter as a flawed follower who loved him deeply and who had gifts that transcended his sins.

We can extend the same healing grace to those around us and to those who have come before us.


Normally I read The Upper Room each morning online at my computer.  I hadn’t seen a paper copy in years until my husband spotted an issue lying on a bench in the lobby of a restaurant one Sunday afternoon.  Apparently someone had left it behind after receiving it at church.  Fearing that the restaurant staff might throw the magazine away, we decided to pick it up and take it home.

Finding the magazine this way made me wonder how many copies of The Upper Room are taken to nursing homes, hospitals, schools, and the homes of invalids.  How many are sent to prisons?  Since The Upper Room is published in 35 languages and is a convenient size, I imagine that many copies cross national borders and travel to remote locations to be received thankfully.  And a few sit on benches waiting for someone to pick them up and say, “I haven’t seen one of these in years!”  Then they put it in their pockets or bags to go into homes, perhaps to be read aloud to others and to touch more hearts.  God’s message of love and grace nurtures everyone it reaches, wherever it goes.


Hannah came to the temple and poured out her misery and troubles to the Lord.  She was without a child but her husband’s other wife had children, and she never let Hannah forget it.  How vigorously did Hannah pour out her troubles to God?  Observing her, Eli, the priest, thought she was drunk and chastised her.  Hannah let him know otherwise, and he told her to go in peace.  

When we open our hearts to God the way Hannah did, everything in us that has held us captive can pour out.  As we let go of these things, the Holy Spirit gentles us, helping us to rest in God, our true refuge.  We find hope, and “hope does not disappoint us because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us” (Rom. 5:5, NRSV).

When we pour out our misery, trials, and fears to God, we will be wrapped in grace.  God pours love into our hearts and brings us healing.


I am privileged to work with remarkable people in a workplace that is largely focused on academic reward.  Yet this highly intellectual environment brings the risk of allowing academic achievement to become the measuring stick of a person’s worth.

Adopting such a value system is easy.  Society often measures our worth by our success, knowledge, or wealth.  But what are these achievements if they are not attained while seeking after God and God’s purposes?  Does any of them make us more important in the Lord’s eyes?  No.

God loves us unconditionally.  Reading Jeremiah 9:23-24, we see that strength, riches, and wisdom are not negatives.  But first and foremost, God longs for us to be people who devote ourselves to seeking God and understanding God’s ways.


Our church’s barbecue-pit-on-wheels, which we call “Grilla,” needed to be towed to an inner-city location where our men’s group was to help feed homeless people.  When Floyd, who usually transports the grill, was not available, I volunteered.  

I let the organizers know that I could tow the trailer with my truck.  However, my skills at backing a trailer, should that become necessary, were limited.  But Floyd told me, “Just go forward most of the time, and you will be fine.”  His response was the encouragement I needed.

Isn’t that God’s urging for us in our life’s journey?  Press on.  Be the hands and feet of Christ.  Yes, there will be occasions when things seem to go in reverse.  But we can keep the faith. We can decide to worry less and pray more. If we just go forward, we will be fine.

That Friday evening, the aroma of burgers cooking on the grill hung in the air over our little section of downtown.  Smiles were exchanged, prayers were offered, and hungry people were fed.  All was fine.


Our baby has dealt with severe eczema since he was about three months old, and it has been difficult to see him live with such an irritating and often painful condition.  At times when the inflammation and itchiness of his skin are so agonizing that he looks at his father and me with tear-filled eyes, all we want to do is hold him close and let him know that we hear his cries.  We want him to know we understand that he is in pain and that we are doing all we possibly can to alleviate it.  This experience has given me a new perspective on the love of God.

We all go through seasons of life that are especially difficult and painful.  In those times I find indescribable reassurance in knowing that just as God heard the cries of the Israelites and knew about their pain as captives in Egypt, God hears our cries of pain, frustration, and desperation.  Not only does God hear us and know us, God wants to bring us comfort and peace.


There’s no doubt about it — I enjoy rock concerts!  They can relieve stress as they allow us to lose some inhibitions.  For a few hours we can sing loudly, dance in the aisles, and generally have a good time with the music we love.  Live concerts are once-in-a-lifetime events, moments in time that will never be repeated.  They are unique.  The music and the event itself often remain in our memories for weeks.

Is the season of Easter a bit like a rock concert in your life?  Do we sing loudly and uninhibitedly dance with joy at the amazing gift that God, through Christ Jesus, offers each of us?  Is it our favorite season?  How long do we remember Easter once we move into the next period of calendar time?

Every Sunday is meant to be a mini-Easter for each of us. We intentionally try to recreate the same joy and thankfulness during Sunday worship each week so we can carry this event into every day.  Our joy can be a witness to the life Christ offers all of us — and that we are meant to offer others.  That way Easter can be a daily reality, not just a memory.


My husband is a careful record keeper.  He tracks our monthly expenses and his students’ grades.  He records the scores of his favorite football team year by year.  Some records are important to keep; others are fun to keep.  However, I’m glad that some records God doesn’t keep at all.  When we repent of our sins, God forgives us and removes our transgressions “as far as the east is from the west” (Ps. 103:12).

I love to think that God has wiped my sin record clean, but sometimes I’m reluctant to do the same for others.  It’s easy for me to keep a mental list of grievances.  I recall times that people have hurt me with unkind words or actions.  I see their faces; I remember what they said.  Am I a secret record-keeper?  When God has blotted out my transgressions, why do I hold on to hurts done to me?  By God’s grace, I resolve to stop my record keeping and to forgive as God has forgiven me.


Dengue fever was becoming prevalent in our area, and my son’s fever was spiking.  Because we didn’t have any money and most private doctors in the Philippines do not offer credit, I thought we should stay home and pray for healing.  However, my wife insisted that we take him to the doctor even with no money in our pockets.  On the way, we stopped by the ATM machine to check our account balance.  We were amazed to find that my salary had been deposited early.

The Israelites found themselves in a similarly difficult position (Exod. 14).  While fleeing from Egypt, the Israelites were caught between the pursuing Egyptians and the Red Sea.  Moses believed in the deliverance of God and exhorted the people to take courage, be silent, do nothing, and see the salvation of God.  But God told Moses to stop talking and go forward; and when they went forward in faith, the Lord delivered them.

Sometimes when we think we are waiting patiently for God, we have actually become paralyzed by fear and insecurity.  At those times, we can pray.  Then we can follow my wife’s example and God’s instruction and move forward in faith.


The community Lenten service inspired me.  Everyone seemed glad to be there on a snowy evening for the preaching, the music, and the fellowship.  What stood out in my mind, however, was the Lord’s Prayer.  It struck me that the preacher only had to say, “Our Father . . . ” and everyone joined in.

People of a dozen different churches and denominations joined in praying the words.  And despite our doctrinal differences, for a moment we were all joined in prayer.  For the seconds that it took us to repeat Jesus’ words, our differences were set aside and we were united in heart and mind.

What a wonderful, if momentary, unity comes when we pray the Lord’s Prayer!  Maybe when we do we take a step toward fulfilling Jesus’ other prayer that we may all be one.  (See John 17:20-23.)


As a child I loved going to my grandma’s house.  She lived four hours away, yet she always had cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven when we arrived.  I picture myself sitting at her kitchen table, surrounded by my brothers and sister, with icing dripping down our chins.

We kids loved our grandma, but the first thing we always wanted to do after finishing our cinnamon rolls was to go see Grandma’s friend Ruth.  Ruth was funny, and we loved spending time with her.  As an adult, I sometimes think back on those visits and wonder how Grandma felt when we dashed off to see Ruth.  Was she sad?  Did she think we loved Ruth more than we loved her?  The truth is that we loved Grandma, but we thought Ruth was more fun.

Unfortunately, we sometimes feel the same way about God.  We love God; but daily concerns seem to be more fun, so we cut short our time with God.  I would like to visit with Grandma a little longer, but she is gone.  However, the Lord is still here, longing to spend time with me, just as Grandma did.  God wants to spend time with you too.


In recent years, several family members have entered the fading years of life, and others have died. I can do little to aid them and nothing to prevent their death. I realize my powerlessness in the face of death and feel caught in the grip of weakness, unable to help those I love or even myself. In these times, I bear in mind that God did not design us for death but for life.

Death stalks all of us, young or old, waiting to snatch away our final breath.  But when death draws close to me and my family, I remember that this is not the end, that goodbye does not last forever, and that eyes that have closed will open again. I may be powerless to overcome death, but my Redeemer, Jesus Christ, has conquered death — and my hope is in him!


When someone asks our sons where they are from, they have no quick and simple answer.  This is because their father’s career sent our family packing every few years — from Hawaii to California to Texas to Virginia and several points in between.  We really have no place we can call our hometown.

Yet in all these places we consistently felt the presence of God, finding our true and permanent home among fellow believers. The buildings, sizes of the congregations, and worship schedules varied; and the local speech patterns and accents changed.  But these differences were slight compared with the common bond we shared. The fellowship we find with God’s people has given us stability, comfort, and security wherever we have lived.

Society seems more transient than ever with continual changes in location, careers, health and financial circumstances, and family structure.  Few people manage to live long without enduring some major life changes and the stresses that come with them.  Like the Israelites who wandered in the wilderness, we may feel as if we are strangers in this world.  What a comfort to know that we cannot move beyond the reach and love of God!


Recently I planted two ornamental plants.  The larger one I planted in a big pot to allow it room to grow.  The other I planted in a much smaller pot, expecting it to remain small.  What a surprise to watch how the plants grew!  The once-smaller plant flourished and grew larger than the first, while the other remained about the same size.

Our spiritual growth can be something like the growth of my plants.  As believers, we each have a measure of grace and have been blessed by God.  But each of us relates to God differently; so, as with my plants, our growth in the Christian life can be very different.

Some of us remain the same for years, attending church but growing little if at all.  Others try new ways of serving and giving and then grow as Christians.  The apostle Paul instructs us to nurture our faith: “Grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ . . . as each part is working properly, [it] promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.”


From time to time our world is shaken by the powerful forces of earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and fires. These events often cause the deaths of thousands.  Afterwards, many attempt to explain these tragic events as God’s punishment, while others ask the classic question: Why?  The psalmist also struggled in the face of tragedy, describing life in terms of darkness and despair but also holding out hope of God’s salvation and deliverance.

In fact, this psalm can be our prayer, too, in the midst of life’s tragedies.  We want someone to remember our plight.  We want the assurance that we are not forsaken but that God will come to our aid.

Our world will never be free of disasters, but even amid life’s storms we can rest assured that God does not forsake those in need.  And we can also resolve to take part in rescuing them.


While wandering through a turtle rescue center, I marveled at the great variety of turtles.  They ranged in size from three inches to three feet, all swimming happily in their assigned tanks —many of them with only one flipper or one eye.

Several turtles swimming in a fresh-water tank particularly intrigued me.  On their shells were barnacles that had attached themselves to the turtles and had flourished in salt water.  The effects of these barnacles can range from stress to the turtle — due to increased surface drag when the turtle swims — to more serious damage from bacterial or fungal infections.  However, now that these turtles had been transferred to fresh water, the barnacles were no longer being nourished and so would eventually disappear.

Like those turtles, we are sometimes weighed down by burdens.  Whether out of indifference or ill nature or traveling with the wrong crowd or ignoring God’s nudges, we create an environment that feeds the “barnacles” of resentment, hatred, irreverence, jealousy, materialism, and other damaging traits.  But if we change our spiritual environment, the attitudes of our sinful nature will no longer thrive.  When we live in an environment shaped by God’s word and surrounded by God’s people, we can focus on the fruit of the Spirit.


I saw a television news story about a 68-year-old Israeli man who, after 10 years of serious heart disease, had received a heart transplant.  The donor was a young Russian man who had died in tragic circumstances.  He had been killed on the street.

A year after the operation the man was able to meet with the mother of the person who had given him life.  The meeting was very emotional.  The woman asked if she could press her ear to his chest so that she could hear the beating heart of her son.

Twenty years ago I was also dying — but in a spiritual sense.   Then I, too, had a heart transplant. Here is how the prophet Ezekiel described my operation: “A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh” (Ezek. 36:26).

My donor, my Savior who gave his life for me, is Christ Jesus.  He also died in tragic circumstances.  He was killed on the cross.  I received from my donor a new heart.  Now the heart of my Savior beats in my chest, and I sing praises to the risen Christ!


I think Jesus deliberately included Samaria in the commission given in today’s quoted scripture.  Jews and Samaritans didn’t get along.  In fact, Jews of Jesus’ time avoided traveling through Samaria even if it meant a much longer journey.  Samaritans were people Jews wanted to avoid.  So it could not have been an accident that Jesus told the disciples to reach out to them.

Considering this, I ask myself, Who are the Samaritans in my life?  We live in a fractious and hateful time, one filled with harsh language that often vilifies people who are on the other side of an issue.  But Jesus demonstrated a different way.  He went through Samaria, not around it. He visited with a Samaritan at a well (John 4).  He held up a Samaritan as a model for being a true neighbor (Luke 10). In other words, he looked for opportunities to build bridges of understanding and love rather than building walls of division.

Where is my Samaria?  That’s where I need to go.  Am I building bridges of understanding and love, as Jesus calls me to do, or am I saying and doing things that help to build walls of separation?

And what about you? Where is your Samaria?


As an older adult, I have set a goal to read more.  My favorite reading material is the Bible.  I firmly believe that reading scripture keeps my mind fresh and revitalizes my soul.  For Sunday school, I read chapters related to the day’s lesson, though often I read them in a hurry.  However, when I want to meditate on those chapters, I make it a point to start with a brief prayer.  Then, with a dictionary nearby to help me find the meanings of words, I delve more deeply into the scripture.  I take my time, often rereading a certain text several times to understand what God is saying to me.

I find this reading to be a tonic for my soul.  My thoughts continue to be nourished by the stories and promises of God — promises that require my commitment so that God’s work will be fulfilled in me.  My prayer is that God’s Spirit will dwell in me and guide my actions as I live each day obedient to what I hear as I reflect on God’s word.


The African violet on top of my refrigerator had bloomed, and the purple flowers were beautiful.  My son gave me the plant when he was eight years old, and the violet had never bloomed before.  Many times over the years I thought I would throw it away because of its hopeless condition, but I didn’t.

Tears ran down my face as I thought about what God had done for my son.  Five months earlier, he had entered a Christian recovery center for drug addicts.  The transformation God has made in his life is miraculous.  Jeremiah 29:11 says that God plans a future for us that is good and full of hope.  I compared my son to the violet.  As I had cared for the plant over the years, I had cared for my son by praying for him.  Eventually, life and beauty came forth from both.

If we throw away our hopes and dreams because the situation looks grim or change takes too long, we may miss what God is about to do.  When we continue to trust, God works faithfully to accomplish good.


One spring day I heard the distinct rat-a-tat of what had to be a woodpecker.  I thought the bird I saw was drilling in a light pole for insects to eat.  But as I watched, I discovered that the busy bird was pecking on the plastic globe of a streetlight.  What a dumb bird!  I thought.  There would be no bugs to gain where it was pecking.  But as I watched what seemed like a futile effort, it occurred to me that I do not know much about such birds.  I might not fully understand the behavior I was seeing.

The next day I researched woodpeckers on the Internet.  I found that what I saw was probably a downy woodpecker whose drumming wasn’t for food but was actually a mating call and an announcement about the bird’s territory.  The bird wasn’t dumb after all.  I was ignorant.

Then I remembered the words of Jesus: “Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment” (John 7:24).  My experience with that bird reminded me that when I strive to learn about an issue before I jump to conclusions that might not be correct, God will help me to make right judgments.


My daughter, Kendria, asked, “Mom, who took Judas’s place after he died?”  I answered confidently, “Matthias.”  She considered this for a moment, then asked, “What did he ever do for Jesus?”  I was stumped by the question of a six-year-old.

I searched the Bible for other mentions of Matthias’s name but found nothing.  However, when the disciples were discussing Judas’s replacement, they chose from those who had been with the group since the baptism of Jesus until the day that he ascended into heaven.  They narrowed it down to two people, Justus and Matthias.  Why were they considered?  Scripture tells us that they had been with the group from the beginning; they were faithful — not flashy, just faithful.

Taking a meal to a sick person, visiting someone in prison, serving in the church, volunteering to help with vacation Bible school, or spending time in prayer for church leaders may not seem like much.  But these acts meet needs in the kingdom of God.  God isn’t looking for people who make headlines; God is looking for those with faithful hearts.  So, to paraphrase my daughter’s question, “What are you doing for Jesus?”


Some time ago I got the frightening news that my first cousin had been kidnapped.  His kidnappers asked for a ransom.  I could not believe it.  What I read about only in newspapers had come to my doorstep.  The immediate and extended family lovingly contributed their money to save our captive cousin.  The ransom was paid, and he was set free.  We all rejoiced.

This experience made me think about the ransom Jesus Christ paid for the salvation of our souls.  The price Christ paid for us became real to me as I thought about what my cousin went through and how we had to buy him back with a price.  How could we ever pay for such a gift?

People say that salvation is free.  It is free to us; however, Christ has paid a dear price for us.  Even when we were sinners, Jesus Christ was willing to die for us.


Over 40 years ago, when my oldest daughter Hope was less than three weeks old, her pediatrician told us, “Stay in town.  Hope won’t live through the night.”  (We lived more than 50 miles from the hospital, over rural roads.)

Hope had been born with a flawed digestive tract.  She did not tolerate any nourishment, not even her mother’s milk.  Her doctor had tried all the cures — soy formula, meat-based formula.  Nothing worked.  Hope had lost too much weight.  She was dying.  The next morning my wife was too distraught to go to the hospital.  Wracked with sorrow, tears blinding me, I rode with a seminary brother who tried to convince me that even in the valley of death God is with us.  I would not be consoled.

I went into the hospital expecting news of Hope’s death and could not understand what I saw: Her pediatrician was giddy with happiness. “It’s a medical miracle!” he gushed.  “Hope is alive!”

Every Good Friday, I relive the feelings of that day long ago as I think about the death of Jesus.  The world was without hope.  Jesus was dead.  I picture evil dancing in joy.  But we know Easter was coming.  Praise God.  Jesus is alive!


Each time I read about Peter’s release from jail, I smile.  The scene opens with Peter sleeping so soundly the angel has to poke him to wake him up.  Once Peter is free, he visits those who had been praying for him.  Rhoda, who answers his knock, is so excited to hear him that she doesn’t let him in!  He is left waiting while she tries to convince the people praying for him that he’s outside.  But they are quicker to believe in a visit from an angel than in a divine rescue.

What were these believers praying for?  If they were praying for Peter’s rescue, they failed to believe God had answered them.  Were they praying without believing, or were they asking for something less than the rescue that God wanted to grant?

We have all prayed for something we perhaps didn’t get: healing from an illness, a job that went to another person.  At such times we can become timid about asking again; so we ask for a small favor instead of what we really want.  We don’t want to be disappointed.  I may never understand why I sometimes see no answer, but I do understand that the cost of praying only small prayers is too high.  God may not grant me many miracles, but how many will I see if I never ask?


My husband and I traveled to Israel with a Christian tour group.  On the eighth day of our trip, we visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The Western Wall is a massive limestone wall where people come to pray.

Men, women, and children of all ages and different religious traditions, dressed in all types of garb, were slowly moving to and from the wall.  As I made my way to the wall to insert my prayer list in one of the crevices between the stones, I noticed with great dismay a woman talking on a cell phone.  Just like home, I thought.  Here we are in a holy place, and she’s talking on the phone!  Suddenly the woman moved the phone from her ear to the wall, held it there for a few moments, and then left quietly.  She had been helping someone who couldn’t be present to be part of praying at the wall with others.  I had just witnessed an expression of the faith of two individuals and a loving act.  I often recall this event, and I’ve recounted it to others on several occasions.

How many times in the course of a week or even a day do we judge before knowing all the facts?  And for that matter, what right do we have to judge another at all?


I arrived at the kindergarten with my daughter and was asked to assemble some new furniture for the children.  The screwdriver they gave me was too small and unsuitable for the job.  It slipped out of the screw head several times and injured me.  I went home and brought back more appropriate tools and completed the work without problem.

I often try to use the “wrong tools” in life, too.  I try to handle tasks in my own way, relying on my own experience and knowledge, without direction from God.  Too often things don’t work out; even worse, I get hurt.  But when I use the right tools — reading and acting on the word of God and seeking God’s direction in prayer — I can complete my tasks with pleasure.

God has given us the tool of holy scripture as “a lamp to [our] feet and a light to [our] path.”  It is a primary tool to help us keep our life together and make us strong and useful for God’s work.


The day after my brother’s funeral, a “Nor’easter” blizzard blew in with winds that whipped the snow into twisting funnels.  That was in April.  The following day I trudged through the cemetery.  It all seemed surreal: my brother’s death, me at his grave, and mounds of snow burying the flowers.  Where was spring — the season we associate with rebirth, regeneration, and resurrection?

When my brother died, I entered a season of severe depression.  I was 40 years old and didn’t attend church or even worship God.  But God still heard my desperate cries for help.  A desire to attend church came over me, and I began searching the telephone directory.  I made an appointment with a pastor for grief/spiritual counseling.  In compassion, God had led me there, and I entered a new season of life when I heard the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ.  My life and my spirit were transformed.  I was born again.

Our loving and merciful God “desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim. 2:4).  No matter what we’ve done, God offers each of us rebirth through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Hope, redemption, and eternal life are God’s priceless gifts to us.


From the moment we moved in, we knew that our neighbors were going to be difficult. They argued loudly, their dogs barked, and their music blared at all hours.

Though we asked them to quiet down, our requests did little more than provoke them.  Their lifestyle and values differed from ours, and nothing seemed to bridge the gap.  So we chose to distance ourselves.

Weeks turned into years.  Weary and frustrated, I asked God, “Why aren’t my prayers enough?  Isn’t this situation ever going to change?”  Troubled, I searched the scriptures.  I came across Jesus’ admonition, “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:39).  The verse was familiar; but in my frustration and anger, I had forgotten that these neighbors were God’s people, just as I am.  God’s words pierced my heart that day, reminding me to not only recite the commandments but to live them out.

My neighbors did not change, but my attitude toward them did; and we were able to live peaceably beside them.


The woman I was visiting had asked me to read the psalm to her; so I should not have been surprised that as I read, she whispered the words, “You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty.”  When I stumbled in my reading, the words poured forth from her.  She told me afterward she had carried that psalm in her heart through some difficult days.  She had been a refugee from a country torn by poverty and violence.  After making a new life in the United States and starting a family, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

I was her hospice chaplain.  I spent time each week reading to her and praying with her.  I was new at the job, and she showed me that the words of scripture are themselves balm to a tired soul.  I had read scripture in private devotion, Bible study and worship, but I had seldom read scripture when I visited those who were ill.

Now I read scripture during many of my visits.  The word of God, without commentary or preaching, comes into our darkest valleys as a source of great comfort and peace — for my patients and for me.


Sometimes when talking with others I give examples of how Jesus responded when faced with temptation.  The usual response to this is, “Yes, but Jesus is God!”

We often think that Jesus had the unfair advantage of being God, that temptation had no effect on him, that he by nature would respond in the best possible way to bad situations.  We prefer to concentrate on Jesus as God, but today’s passage from Hebrews reminds us that Jesus was completely human, suffering as all of us do.

Jesus shared in our humanity.  He struggled in the Garden of Gethsemane; he was betrayed by a close disciple.  He endured public rejection and humiliation and the awful pain of flogging and crucifixion.  Were all of these just God going through a charade?  Was life easy for Jesus?  No.  Jesus experienced every sensation and every emotion, just as any of us would.  However, in spite of it all, he remained pure and blameless.  That is what makes the message so powerful.  The gospel is not about how God effortlessly came to save us but how God became “fully human in every way” (v. 17) — made like his brothers and sisters — and died to save us.

“Salvation is free,” we say.  Yes, it is free for us to receive — but it came at great cost to the Giver.


My grandmother came to Argentina from Russia.  Painful memories of war reflected from her light, almost transparent eyes.  Those eyes had the appearance of being on the verge of tears that you could not wipe away.  She left behind her parents and sister, never to see them again.  Grandmother Xenia held on to her Slavic traditions as a way to remember her family.

As was the custom in my grandmother’s native land, Holy Week was a busy time with much preparation leading up to Easter — purchases to make, meal preparation, and housecleaning.  My grandmother lovingly prepared delicacies for the Easter Sunday meal — tea prepared in the samovar, blini (Russian pancakes), kasha (porridge), kotlety (meatballs), and most of all pashka (Russian Easter cheese dessert).

Finally, Easter Sunday would arrive and with it the true reason for our family celebration.  As we sat around the table, my grandmother would raise her cup of tea and offer us a greeting with a gracious smile: “Christos voskrese (Christ has risen)!”  And in one voice we responded:  “Voistinu voskrese (Truly Christ has risen)!”

Many years have passed; family customs and traditions have changed; but we still honor the love and sacrifice of Christ.


I collect flashlights of various shapes and sizes.  I have a small one in my purse, a stand-up one in my car, a variety of old ones in my closet, and several sturdy ones posted around the house in case of an emergency.  Why collect flashlights?  Because I feel afraid in the dark.

Because Jesus said he is the Light of the world, I know that wherever I go, whatever happens, I have the most powerful Light in the world with me and I need not be afraid of what the future holds.  Christ is my source of light, and as his follower, I am to light up the world around me with love and grace.

We are each different vehicles of the light of Christ, but each one of us has the responsibility and joy of bringing this light into a dark world.  Together, we light the way to truth so others can find their way to God.


As a child, I saw that my parents believed in tithing.  They gave 10% of their income to our church and to those who were needy.  I remember my father often telling me, “The more we give away, the more we get back.”  At the time his words did not make sense to me.  I couldn’t understand how giving away money could result in having more.

But soon after my wife and I began tithing almost 20 years ago, we began to understand what my father had been telling me.  The more we gave away, the more we received — not just from the standpoint of financial return but more importantly from the joy of knowing we had helped our church and God’s children.

Whether our tithe is a small or large sum, the Lord is pleased with our offering.  Attitude is just as important as the amount we give.  God loves a cheerful giver!


We had just finished a particularly busy Holy Week and Easter weekend when our 15-month-old son was injured.  He pulled a tablecloth from a table, and the cloth brought with it a square, rough-cut glass vase that sliced his nose open as it fell.  It was a serious cut.

At the hospital, we had to wait six hours for treatment; they had to delay administering anesthesia because he had eaten just before the incident.  When his treatment time came, his mother and I accompanied him into the operating room to keep him calm; but he panicked anyway.  As the medical team struggled to hold the mask over his face long enough for the anesthesia to take effect, they bumped his nose, starting the bleeding again.  Blood was everywhere; it even ran back into his eyes.  With those blood-filled eyes he looked at us as if asking, “Why are you standing and watching them hurt me like this?  Why aren’t you doing something to help me?”  I told him that this was the only way to “make it better.”

Then it dawned on me:  God watched Jesus dying on the cross, as Jesus asked, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  But Christ’s death was God’s only way to “make it better,” to heal us and to take away the pain and the penalty of our sin.


When I was young, the stores along Main Street in our small town closed their doors from noon to 3 p.m. on Good Friday to commemorate the hours Jesus hung on the cross.  My family sat through the entire three-hour service that rotated among the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches because they had the largest sanctuaries in the community.  This observance was a formative experience in my life.

The cultural patterns of those days are long gone.  We gave up the noon-to-3:00 service decades ago in favor of a shorter service on Good Friday night, a tradition that goes back to the Middle Ages and one that I appreciate more every year.

But evidently those childhood experiences conditioned me to think of Jesus as hanging on the cross only at that time of day.  The Gospel of Mark, however, says that Jesus was crucified at 9 a.m.  Then midday darkness covered the earth from noon to three.  I shuddered at the sudden awareness that Jesus was on the cross for six hours — an eternity in that hell.  No wonder Jesus prayed, “My God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34).  Who wouldn’t feel God-forsaken in a time like that?

And yet Good Friday is not a time for theorizing about how we are saved by God’s love at the cross.  Rather, it is a time simply to hear the story, to experience the love, and kneel in wonder in the presence of a God-forsaken Christ like this.


Years ago I visited the tomb of Russia’s Vladimir Lenin in Moscow and then later, China’s Chou En-lai in Beijing.  In each tomb, the body of the former leader was preserved in a clear coffin where his faithful followers could see it as they paid their respects.  As I emerged from each of those tombs, the same thought went through my mind: Where could Jesus’ followers go to see his body?  The answer, of course, is nowhere!

I also have visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, built around the traditional site of Jesus’ tomb.  I personally liked another site better, one called Gordon’s Garden Tomb.  While it may or may not have been the tomb of Jesus, it was more like what I imagined his tomb to be.  I went inside past a large stone in a groove to permit rolling it to seal the tomb door.  I saw where a body would have been laid, but no body lay in either of these two Jerusalem tombs.

No major religion except Christianity claims that its founder rose from the dead.  If this claim by Jesus’ followers had not been true, all that the authorities would have had to do was point to his dead body.  They tried to say his disciples stole it but would those who hid on Easter evening “for fear of the Jews” (John 20:19) have later sacrificed their lives if they knew the Resurrection was a lie?  Three leaders, three tombs, but only one leader is alive today!


As a child, I stood outside a railway station waiting to be picked up by an aunt with whom I was to spend my holiday. I had not met her before; I had only seen her photograph.  How would I find her in this bustling sea of people?  Then I heard my name.  That call was quickly followed by a smile and a hug from the aunt in my picture.  I was somebody again in that crowd.

I imagine it was something like that for Mary from Magdala on the morning of Jesus’ resurrection.  The pre-dawn darkness would have accentuated the horrible emptiness of her loss.  Her face was lined from weeping, and the empty grave made her sorrow complete.  In the growing light, even angels seemed unconvincing.  And then she heard the risen Jesus say her name: Mary!

For me, all the joy, the hope, and the wonder of Easter come with that meeting between Mary and Jesus.  Death turns to life; endings become beginnings.  But the best of all is recognizing that in Jesus I can be sure God not only knows about me but knows my name.  That is Easter.  That is why Christ lived and died and rose again — so that each of us may know ourselves as deeply valued by God in the midst of the world’s crowds.


“I know that my hair is sometimes questionable when I get out of bed in the morning,” my husband smiled as he walked into the kitchen for his morning coffee.  “But I just looked in the mirror, and what I saw almost frightened me!”

I smiled because I could certainly relate to what he was saying.  Who hasn’t looked in the mirror and been shocked, surprised, or amused at what they saw?  Mirrors play a very important part in helping us maintain our appearance, and what we see influences how we feel about ourselves.  But is a mirror that shows us how we appear to ourselves and to other people as valuable as one that would allow us to see ourselves as God sees us?

Easter is the perfect reflection of how God feels about us.  When we look at the cross, we see that God loves us enough to die to have a relationship with us.  That tells us how much God values each one of us.  When we look at the empty tomb, we see that no matter what happens, God has the power to see us through anything — even death.  Knowing this, we can face life with trust.  Jesus came to show us God and to reflect God’s love for us.  (See John 14:8-9.)  Easter invites us to see ourselves worthy of redemption, loved beyond measure, and created for eternal life!


I recently traveled with my sister to visit her daughter and grandchildren.  During our stay, I could not help but observe how much the children adored their grandmother, their “YaYa.”  Five-year-old Kyler wanted to be with her constantly.  When we sat down to eat, he insisted on sitting by YaYa.  When we walked down the street, he held YaYa’s hand.  He was totally enamored of her.  Near the end of the week, I asked him, “Kyler, why do you love YaYa so much?”  At first he shrugged and said, “I don’t know.”  Then he suddenly brightened, as if the answer had just come to him, and exclaimed, “Because she loves me!”

What a simple and honest answer!  We all want to be loved, and we tend to love the people who love us.  My sister would give her life for her grandchild, and he sensed the depth of her love.  So it is with us.  We do not love God in order to gain God’s love.  We love God because God first loved us.  Just as Kyler’s love is a natural response to his grandmother’s love, our devotion to God is a natural response to God’s great love for us.


In our Bible discussion, we looked at the four Gospels’ accounts of the resurrection of Jesus.  We discovered that each of the Gospels reports a different version of how the events took place.

Even though the Gospels present different accounts of the resurrection, all four agree on one central truth: our crucified Lord overcame death and rose again after three days, as he had promised (Luke 24:7).  To us who believe, Christ’s victory over death granted salvation and the right to become children of God (John 1:12).

As we celebrate and commemorate the risen Lord this Easter, I am comforted to know that we are all heirs of God’s kingdom through his resurrection.  We may come from different denominational backgrounds and see God’s work differently, but we are all united in our joy as we celebrate the resurrection of Christ.


My family believes in God but will not attend church with me.  At times, I become discouraged, and my attendance becomes irregular.

One Sunday instead of going to church alone, I decided to stay home with my family.  I was feeling sorry for myself and cried out to God about my loneliness and my longing for family worship.  Not long after I prayed, I heard a knock at the door.  My brother stood on our porch with his five-year-old daughter, Emma.  He asked if she could go to church with me.  Emma had gotten up that morning, dressed, and told him that she wanted to go to church.  My brother doesn’t attend church; but he did not want to discourage Emma, so he drove the ten miles to my home to send her to church with me.

That day, I did not sit alone in church.  As I held Emma’s hand, I realized that God had spoken to me through this child.  Emma helped me not to feel so alone.  God showed love to both of us that day.


From the whale-watching ship, I saw the whale surface.  For long minutes I looked into one of its huge eyes, knowing that I was seen as well as seeing.  Then the whale disappeared into the deep, to surface at other times and places.

In a similar way, God, who is always moving in the depths of existence, is revealed on the surface of our lives.  The resurrected Christ shows us what is always true — that life is stronger than death and far more than meets the eye.  The Resurrection means that Christ Jesus continues to work in our depths, at times surfacing unexpectedly to be with us in unmistakable ways.  In those moments we see and know we are seen, and we sense our connection.  Christ then returns to work in our depths, leaving us with sure knowledge of his reality.

We do not know when Christ will make himself known nor what he does in the times we do not see him.  But we do know that the risen Lord is present, whether on the surface or in the depths of our lives, transforming us beyond our understanding.  And we cherish those moments when the Resurrection is not just a doctrine but also a personal experience, when we look into the face of our Lord and know that we are not only seen but also loved.


As a young girl, I was painfully shy and longed to be popular and outgoing.  The girls in a newly-formed “club” invited me to join, to meet them at a local store for the club initiation, and then to attend a slumber party.  When we met at the store, I learned that membership was earned by shoplifting.  With a racing heart, I walked to a shelf with Bible bookmarks, slipped a bookmark into my notebook, and returned to the sidewalk.  The other girls questioned me, “Well, what did you get?”  I displayed my ill-gotten prize.

The party wasn’t much fun for me.  While the others chatted, I silently asked God’s forgiveness.  My parents had taught me to be honest.  The next day, I confessed and my dad drove me back to the store.  I returned the bookmark and told Dad I would take my punishment.  His comment was, “You’ve punished yourself more than I would; you’re forgiven.”

Like my earthly father, God loves us even when we stray and willingly forgives us.


When my oldest daughter, Molly, was five, she was learning to offer thanks at the dinner table.  She began with the expected, “Thank you, God, for this meal, and for my mommy and daddy.”  She then proceeded to look around the table, adding, “Thank you for mustard and for pickles and hamburger buns and for plates . . .” Although at first I found this merely a cute anecdote to share with friends, I’ve come to realize how meaningful her words really were.

In a world where food is scarce for many families, including some in my own community on the U.S./Mexico border, those of us who are able to place a nourishing meal on our table and look around at loving friends and family have reason to be deeply thankful.  Even things we often overlook or take for granted — from condiments to cleaning supplies — may be a much-appreciated luxury to others.

I realize the importance of giving to local food banks, delivering or making meals for shut-ins, or contributing to other charities helping to feed the hungry.  I continue to try to appreciate not just the “big blessings” in my life but also the small gifts that make my days colorful and special.


Pahliwe is a young Xhosa woman who knows the Bible and is devoted to Jesus Christ.  She lives in a homeless shelter in the Western Cape province of South Africa, but she longs to find work to support herself and make a home. I met her through my work with The Upper Room.

Pahliwe and others at this shelter have been using The Upper Room daily devotional guide for several months.  This week on the train going into Cape Town to look for work, Pahliwe dozed off with the magazine on her lap.  When it fell to the floor, a man sitting next to her picked it up and began to read.  When Pahliwe awoke, he asked if the magazine belonged to her.  “Well,” she said, “it was mine, but now it is yours.”  He was very pleased and said that he was glad to have it as he traveled home to Zimbabwe.

Hearing this story, I imagined other ways God might use this little guide.  I presented a thrilled Pahliwe with five new copies of The Upper Room — one for herself and four to give away to others.

Pahliwe’s story reminds us that as we go through our everyday routine, God can use us to serve others— even when we are unaware.


The stranger spoke three words. What he said reminded me of God’s presence, even to the depths of the seemingly bottomless pit I had hurled myself into.  I tried to smile through my tears.  I paid for my wine coolers and left the store, afraid the man would see the emotion his words had evoked. I couldn’t tell you what he looked like because I couldn’t face him without revealing my shame. But I do remember his words, “Jesus loves you.”

At first, I wanted to snap back at him, “I am well aware.”  After all, my father was a preacher.  I hadn’t always been the sniveling wreck I had become, buying alcohol to drown my pain.  Did he recognize the condition of my self-destructive soul?  Did he understand the depth of his words?  Through them, God was calling me back.

Over the next three years I often thought of his words.  All that time, God, ever patient, was waiting for me.  I began to pray, read scripture, and worship with God’s people.  The moment I turned toward home, God was there to pull me up, to dust me off, to love me through the mess I had made of my life, and to bring me back to the “road that leads to life” (Matt. 7:14).


Every morning I write down a verse of scripture to remember as a motto for the day.  One day my exhortation had to do with not slandering.  I know that spreading rumors with the intention of harming someone is wrong.

But it occurred to me later that there is a form of speech as insidious as untruth: speaking of another’s faults to a third person — even though the faults may be real.  We are prone to tell others about the wrong someone has done or about a particular weakness someone struggles with.  Even though no lies are told, such talk can cause prejudice or suspicion.  Relationships can be negatively affected.

That day as I was reflecting on my motto from scripture, a man called to tell me a story that I was confident was not true.   My first reaction was:  I will tell my colleagues about this!  But doing so would have harmed the reputation of the person he was calling me about.  Then I remembered the verse that I had read that morning and by the grace of God, I said nothing.  Now I make it a practice to ask the Lord to watch over the door of my lips.  (See Ps. 141:3.)


Every week I volunteer at a juvenile detention center with others from my church.  My goal when I joined this ministry was to change these young people and give them the tools they need to make it in the world today.

Early on in my volunteer work, one of the former inmates was re-arrested (unfortunately, a fairly common occurrence).  I saw that achieving my goal wouldn’t be easy.  As volunteers, we provide a positive influence for the young people as we talk to them about life and introduce them to passages of scripture that can guide them when they are released.

But how are we ever going to change them?  Instead of becoming discouraged, I re-read the verse (above) that inspired me to get involved in the first place.  Jesus never said to change anyone.  Whether we are meeting a stranger, a prisoner, or someone who is sick, Jesus gave us his direction.  Visit these people.  Spend time with them.  I have to trust that God will work through us to reach these young people during our visits and beyond.

I try not to become discouraged when I learn that a former resident is in trouble again.  I return to the detention center the next week to show unconditional love.


“I can tell you’re mother and daughter,” the salesclerk said.  We smiled, making no comment.  We’ve heard it before, and it always amuses us because we do not share DNA.  My husband and I adopted our daughter when she was six weeks old.

So what makes us look alike?  Living with me for 20 years, my daughter has picked up many of my characteristics.  We think alike; our reactions are similar.  In other ways we are quite different, but observers notice the ways we are the same.

When we are adopted into the family of God with Christ as our elder brother, something similar happens.  We spend time with God and with other believers; we discuss important ideas, and we gradually become more like Christ.  We hope that when we go out into the world, people are reminded of God’s love and compassion and want to follow Christ because of what they see in our lives.


My aunt had to move because of declining health.  We put her house up for sale.  The realtor who came by saw what I had not seen: small carpet stains, a leaking faucet, mold around a bathtub, a loose handle on a cabinet, and chipped paint on facings.  “Those things seem small,” she said, “but they make a huge difference in whether the house sells or doesn’t.  Please get them fixed before we put the sign out front.”

As I dealt with getting repairs done, God led me to begin thinking about the “small things” in my life — the bit of gossip I repeat, the minor resentments I hold on to, the way I sometimes shade the truth to my benefit, my pride and self-justification, judging the actions and worth of others. I wondered if these are actually sins.

Honestly, I knew that the answer is yes.  I had committed sins and dismissed them as mere human failings.  But they were sins and were obscuring the grace of God in my life.

In forgiveness and love, God helped me to be more honest and to confess my sins.  God’s love and grace guided me through the period of helping my aunt and enabled me to begin a process of spiritual growth that led me to deeper faith and greater joy in my relationships.


Years ago in my college philosophy class, we studied the passage in the Book of Acts that chronicled Paul’s time in Athens.  I was surprised to learn that discussion between Christians and philosophers was a more ancient tradition than I imagined.  To the Greek way of thinking, the professor explained, it was inconceivable that a god could die; gods were immortal and, therefore, could not die.  I was amazed at the image of Paul speaking of Jesus’ resurrection and enduring the mockery of the philosophers.  Even so, scripture says, “Some people joined him and came to believe” (Acts 17:34).

Years later, I accepted Christ as my Savior.  I remembered the philosophy class, and I thought about how great the Lord truly is — to be immortal and the Supreme Being who not only died for us but rose from the dead and lives today.  This speaks to our sense of reasoning and to our spirit.

Many Christians view Jesus’ resurrection as ancient history, perhaps as some did in my philosophy class.  But though it happened over 2,000 years ago, Christ lives today.  The resurrection is not another ancient story with a good moral to be remembered on Easter Sunday.  The resurrection is the reality that sustains our faith and anchors our reasoning.


Years ago I developed a painful and disabling spinal problem.  I could no longer work, play, or volunteer.  Only appointments with doctors and various therapists broke up the long, lonely days at home.  I felt that all my energy, time, and money were focused on me and my body.  It seemed that I had nothing left to contribute to the world.

Then, Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 12 changed my perspective:  “The members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.”  I marveled at how God can turn the world’s thinking upside down.  I learned that I was valuable and needed just as I was.  God helped me see that I had the opportunity to serve Christ by sharing his love with all the healthcare workers who were trying to help me.  They could know Christ’s love by the way I treated them, and I could pray for them and their work daily.

An even greater insight, however, was that I was providing a way for them to serve Christ by helping me to heal.  We need one another in the body of Christ.  Weak and strong together, we can learn the importance of both giving and receiving God’s love.


As she prayed for me, my friend said to God, “Let Nancy know she’s your favorite daughter.”  God doesn’t have favorites!  I thought.  I knew God couldn’t answer a prayer like that.

Later that day, I came across photos of my dear friend Doreen, who had died of bone cancer years earlier. I remembered her memorial service.  As friends and family told stories about her, several women described themselves as Doreen’s closest friend.  They’re mistaken, I thought.  After all, I was her best friend.  Doreen had so lavishly, unselfishly loved us all that each of us thought we were her favorite.  She lived so well Jesus’ commandment to love that I’d felt completely, unconditionally loved.

The Lord interrupted my memories, speaking gently in my heart, “That’s like my love.”  I told God that I didn’t understand.  God said to me, “You don’t have to understand.  Only believe.”  And I do believe.

Still, I wondered how God could love me.  I am certainly no saint.  Then I remembered the stories of David — a liar, an adulterer, and a murderer and yet was “a man after [God’s] own heart” (Acts 13:22).  To my surprise, I realized that I am God’s favorite.  Each one of us is.


While taking Marius out for some grandpa-grandson time, I was preoccupied.  Usually, I would have played some children’s praise music, but I had forgotten to turn it on.  I heard Marius asking from the backseat, “Where’s our music, Grandpa?”

We maneuvered through traffic with the music playing, but again my mind wandered to work and the impossible deadlines I faced.  I was resting my head on my hand when Marius asked, “What’s wrong, Grandpa?”

I told him I had a headache.  Then I heard him praying, “God, please help Grandpa to feel better.  Amen.”  As we drove on a bit further, Marius requested a favorite Bible story, “Tell me the story about Samuel, when he was sleeping.”  I told the story.  When Marius wanted to hear it again, I did a replay.

As we reached our destination, I realized that my grandson, not I, had been the teacher that day — and why Jesus told us to model our lives of faith on that of little children.  If we praise God, if we identify the needs of others and pray for their hurts, if we love and tell the stories of faith, we will live well.  I have made the Christian life way too complicated.  To Marius, it is simple.


I frequently travel by plane, and generally the flights are pleasant.  On one occasion, however, the pilot alerted us to buckle our seat belts because we would be passing through an area of turbulence.  The flight attendant started to move briskly about the cabin, and I tensed up with fear.  I was not prepared for such turbulence, and neither were the rest of the passengers.  After what seemed an eternity, though in reality it was only a few minutes, the plane regained stability and I breathed a sigh of relief.  As the pilot had said, the turbulence was localized.

Later, when I recalled this incident, I thought of our earthly life.  The Lord does not promise us a life without strife.  On the contrary, we will all go through bumpy times.  However, when they come we can remember that we are only passing through some turbulence and that God is with us.  Our faith steadies us.


Recently while filling out job applications, I completed several personality assessments.  Many of these questionnaires have asked me to compare my own traits and abilities to those of the general population.  After completing several of these surveys, I realized I had repeatedly chosen the response, “I perform (a specific task) at least as well as most others.”  This repeated response reminded me that I often use others as the gauge of my conduct.

The apostle Paul, in his letter to the church in Ephesus, reminds me that rather than comparing myself to those around me, I should strive to follow Jesus’ example.  His life is the perfect example for me to follow.

As ambassadors for Christ and children of God, we are called to be set apart, holy.  God loves us and accepts us as we are, but we have a higher standard to aim for.  I know I will never be sinless, but I can work to sin less as I look to Jesus as my role model.  Rather than comparing myself to my peers, I now ask myself, How am I measuring up to Jesus’ standard for my life?  I want to seek first to please God rather than the people around me.


Although I am a lifelong Christian, I did not feel much like an immortal soul and did not have much confidence that I would rise to eternal life when medical tests revealed that I had cancer.  But as I reflected on the Easter story, I found that I believed strongly in the resurrection of Jesus.  And because Jesus rose, I had reason to believe that he would rescue me from death as well.

Out of gratitude, I began to pray more regularly.  Perhaps because of my weak faith, I did not pray for cure of my cancer; but I did take time to praise God each day for what I had.  Sometimes as chemotherapy and radiation took their toll, my prayers were little more than incoherent babbling.  But with the aid of the Spirit, I kept praying.  (See Rom. 8:26.)

I endured months of treatments, underwent three major operations, and had a colostomy for a while.  My father died while I was going through all this.  At the end of that awful time, my wife said, “This must have been the worst year of your life.”

I thought about that for a minute, and I realized that throughout those difficult days I had been comforted with a profound sense of Christ’s presence.  “You know,” I told her, “it may have been the best.”  Knowing Christ is with us transforms us and our struggles.


Four-year-old Brenda slipped unseen from her mother’s pew.  She walked down the aisle to the front of the church, where her pastor stood making the weekly announcements.  Taking the pastor’s hand, she announced, “I’m hungry!” The embarrassed mother hurried to retrieve her child and bring her back to the pew.  She assured the youngster that they would eat when they got home.

The little girl’s statement stuck with me as the service continued.  How many of us have come to church “hungry” today?  Are the others in the congregation spiritually hungry for more of God?  Am I?  Did I enter the sanctuary expecting to be spiritually fed from the Lord’s table?

Now each Sabbath I make a conscious effort to come to church hungry.  I wait expectantly for the Holy Spirit to feed my heart and soul.  Then I continue my spiritual journey, nourished, invigorated, and fed.


One day at the close of my devotional time, I said a special prayer for my 12-year-old son, Esteban.  At the time, my wife was with our son at the hospital.  At midnight, the phone rang.  It was my wife, Doreen, with the news confirming that Esteban had meningitis.  This was especially alarming because in those days in 1993 many young children had died from meningitis.  I hung up the phone, fell to my knees, and prayed.  I placed Esteban in God’s hands, as my wife and I had done countless times since his birth.

The next day a medical treatment plan for my son was initiated.  Praying constantly, my wife and I placed our hope in the Great Healer to restore our son’s health.  God heard our prayers and the prayers of our brothers and sisters in the community of faith.  After several months, Esteban pulled through.

Today Esteban serves God.  He plays piano in our worship services and is an English professor deeply invested in his students and their achievements.  Doreen and I are grateful to God not only for restoring Esteban’s health but also for the ways God is bringing wholeness to Esteban’s Christian life. Our family has learned to wait on the Lord even in the midst of life’s most challenging moments.


The butcher I worked with in a small-town grocery store showed me the best way to sharpen knives.  I watched as he used a round metal file to sharpen not only his knives but his cleavers as well.  Then he taught me the technique.  Today I own a file, and my knives are always sharp.

The process of sharpening requires that iron meet iron.  The friction wears away a dull edge to form a new one.  My butcher friend told me that a dull knife isn’t safe; it’s actually more likely to cause serious injury.  And a dull knife obviously doesn’t do the job as effectively as a sharp one.  So sharpening makes a tool more efficient and prepares it for the next job.

Similarly, our Christian friends can help us remain open to God’s work in us.  Their counsel may seem like unwanted friction at times, but we need friends who remind us of God’s wisdom, keep us grounded in truth, and hold us accountable.  Such accountability prepares us for the work God has for us to do.


In my Bible study group, John requested prayer for his elderly neighbor, Sam, who had suffered a serious fall.  John was helping run errands for Sam.  Our group leader prayed for Sam’s health and also that John would have a chance to speak to Sam about Christ.  Afterwards, John remarked, “It never occurred to me to talk with Sam about Jesus.”

One person in our group said that helping Sam was, in fact, witnessing to him.  And to be sure, it is.  But another person said, “Telling him about Christ goes one step further.”

That made me think.  I enjoy visiting people who are sick or lonely, and I help by giving them rides and meeting other needs.  But how often do I speak to them about my faith?  Do others know that I do these loving acts because Christ is my savior?  Do they know what courage and strength and love Christ brings to my life?

Although I enjoy the friendships I make, my goal should be to draw people not to myself but to Christ by reading scripture or a devotional or offering to pray.  From now on, I want to go one step further and witness about my faith in Christ with words as well as deeds.


When we were adolescents, my brother and I strove fiercely to win our dad’s approval.  This created a pattern of competition that continues to interfere with our relationship years later.  During a recent wilderness hike, my brother took the lead.  The trail wasn’t especially difficult, and he set a frantic pace.  Before long, however, he was gasping and suffering muscle cramps.  We made it back safely, but that competitiveness made it difficult for us to enjoy our time together.

As a young Christian, I strove fiercely to win God’s approval as well.  I tried to be a perfect Christian: I tried to pray longer, I read the Bible more diligently, and I behaved more piously than everyone else.  That attitude, however, only alienated those around me.

When I read Ecclesiastes 7:15-20, I was appalled.  How could someone be too righteous?  And how could the writer suggest that we tolerate evil?  Finally, I realized that, try as I might, I can never be perfect.  I can live as pure and holy a life as possible and avoid pretension of righteousness, but I don’t have to win God’s approval.  It’s free and unconditional.  I need only to accept it.


Recently I was cleaning out drawers in my kitchen.  In one drawer were recipe books and lots of recipes needing to be filed.  Some of the recipes had been cut from magazines; some came from friends; some from my mother.  I had collected many of them for years, but most I had never tried.  The dishes made from these recipes might taste fabulous, might even become family favorites.  But to find out I must make the dish and then taste the finished product.

My Bible is a bit like my recipe drawer.  In it and in other notebooks, I have Bible verses written out, along with quotes from Christian writers and speakers.  Most of these had great meaning for me at various times in my life.

Like the recipes, the word of God has to be “tasted” — tried and acted on.  Through the Bible God speaks to us, nourishes us, supports us.  We are to read it regularly, with faith, and follow its wisdom.  When a passage from God’s word gets our attention, it is not meant to be a “cut-out” word that we carry as a note stuck between the pages of our Bible.  Rather, each insight is something to meditate on and live until it becomes part of us.


My husband has been out of work this past year.  And this was not the first time; over the last 20 years he has been laid off five times.  Each time has become more difficult for us as husband and wife and as a family.  Our three children have endured many hardships and fears related to this.  We’ve experienced days with no oil for heat or propane for hot water.  We’ve had empty food shelves and no electricity. We even endured a three-week period without a car, making it difficult to get to school, stores, and church in our suburban area.

Even though we’ve experienced hardships, we’ve also received care by unexpected means.  People have given us food, cars, propane, money, and their prayers and support.  These people served as God’s angels to us during these times, and we’ve learned to trust God to help us meet our needs.  God has blessed us far more than the beautiful lilies Jesus described.  When we know and accept God’s love, we can face tomorrow’s challenges with confidence that all will be well.


The Lord did not bless my father with a pleasant singing voice.  Quite the opposite: Dad couldn’t carry a tune even if it had handles on it.  Standing next to him in church made singing hymns difficult.  My mother sang in the choir.  My sister and I often shared a hymnal with Grandma, leaving Dad to howl in solitude at the other end of the pew.  This never seemed to bother him.  Each worship service found him enthusiastically adding his dissonant voice to the great hymns of the faith.  He truly did make a “joyful noise” — every Sunday.

The quality of our vocal efforts is not important to God.  God doesn’t care if we sing like angels or bleat like goats.  God, who created us, knows our abilities.  The act of praise from those who love God pleases God.  When we sing in worship, we aren’t performing for the approval of the people around us.  We’re lifting our voices to please God, who loves us, cares for us, and died for us.


Today in my country, we are suffering from tremendous insecurity because of widespread violence.  This has caused many of us to avoid owning automobiles or jewelry because having them exposes us to the danger of losing our possessions or even our lives.  Living under these extreme circumstances reminds us of Jesus’ message not to store up treasures on earth but to seek rather the kingdom of heaven.

Even with all our precautions not to appear wealthy, a young man wielding a gun stole my wife’s car.  My wife was not harmed, thank goodness; and the thief did not take her purse or the keys to our house.  However, we have not been able to forget this incident.  My wife reminds me, “We did not lose only the car; we lost our security and sense of peace.”

Today, we live modestly out of necessity rather than conviction.  The disciples of Jesus went a step further.  For their faith, they left everything they knew to seek the kingdom of heaven.  Our challenge is to nurture our spiritual growth and to place it ahead of absurd accumulation of riches — to act out of faith rather than fear.


A retreat was held in a setting that offered mountains, forests, and a nearby lake — perfect places to explore and enjoy God’s marvelous creation.  Before we ate our first midday meal, our retreat leader suggested that we spend our early-afternoon break wandering and relaxing in the area surrounding our cabins.  “Go marveling,” she said.  “Find something in nature to bring back with you.”

That evening, we brought the items we had found during the afternoon: feathers, leaves, oddly-shaped limbs, seedpods, wildflowers, and rocks.  We told the stories of our discoveries and celebrated God’s gifts.  The gift of marveling at the works of our Creator energized us and brought us together.

From that experience, I learned that I can go marveling most anywhere.  When I see a brilliant red, orange, and gold sunset, I marvel.  When I hear a bird singing, I marvel.  When the air smells clean and the world grows still with the first snowfall of the season, I marvel.  When fluffy clouds billow in the afternoon sky, I marvel.  Sometimes I let the busyness of the day interfere with enjoying nature’s beauty, but I try to save part of every day to pay attention to God’s “wonderful works.”
