To ensure that your Ruby application uses the Ollama provider for the Mistral model, we need to ensure that the `AiClient` is configured correctly. The errors indicate that the application is still trying to access the Mistral provider instead of Ollama.

Let's break down the process of correctly setting up your `AiClient` instance to utilize the Ollama provider. Make sure to verify that the default provider switch is correctly implemented within your `AiClient` class, especially in the `determine_provider` method.

### Key Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Specify the Provider Explicitly**: When creating the `AiClient` instance, it seems you are already specifying the provider explicitly, but ensure that no other part of your code is overriding this setting.

2. **Check `determine_provider`**: This method in the `AiClient` class should prioritize the specified provider over the model-based determination. However, based on your setup, it looks fine; it should not switch to Mistral if it's set to Ollama explicitly.

3. **Configuration**: Double-check the configuration block to ensure it is not overwriting the desired provider settings.

### Example Code Update

Here is your `text.rb` setup with comments explaining a few key areas to watch for:

```ruby
# Ensure requires
require_relative '../ai_client'

# Configuration
AiClient.configure do |config|
  config.return_raw = false   # set to true if you want raw responses
end

title "Using Mistral model with Ollama locally"

# Create an AiClient instance explicitly telling it to use the Ollama provider
ollama_client = AiClient.new('mistral', provider: :ollama)

puts "\nModel: mistral  Provider: Ollama (local)"

# Instead of 'model: "mistral"', we just pass the message as that is where the model 
# is already set in the AiClient initialization
result = ollama_client.chat('Hello, how are you?')

puts result

puts "\nRaw response:"
puts ollama_client.response.pretty_inspect

# Example for checking other configurations.
models = ['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'claude-2.1', 'gemini-1.5-flash', 'mistral-large-latest']
clients = models.map { |model| AiClient.new(model) }

title "Default Configuration Responses"
clients.each do |client|
  puts "\nModel: #{client.model} (#{client.model_type})  Provider: #{client.provider}"
  puts client.chat('hello')
end

# ... Rest of your code
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

If issues persist:

- **Log the Configuration**: Insert logging statements in the `initialize` method of `AiClient` to log which provider is selected when the client is created. This can help debug if itâ€™s somehow reverting to Mistral.

- **Inspect the Response**: If you receive a `403 Forbidden` error, ensure that the environment variables for API keys are correctly set and that your subscription to the provider is active.

- **Check Middleware**: If you have any middlewares that alter requests, ensure that they are correctly forwarding the provider settings without modification.

This setup should ensure that your script uses the Ollama provider for your Mistral model and should help you avoid the issue of inadvertently calling the Mistral API endpoint.
