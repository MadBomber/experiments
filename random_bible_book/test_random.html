<h2>Casting Lots for Bible Study</h2>

<p>What book of the bible should you study next?  If that "still small voice" has not directed you to a specific book try what the apostles did in Acts 1:26  "Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias. So he was numbered with the 11 apostles."</p>

<div id="book_1" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Genesis</h2>
  <p>Genesis speaks of beginnings and is foundational to the understanding of the rest of the Bible. It is supremely a book that speaks about relationships, highlighting those between God and his creation, between God and humankind, and between human beings.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Genesis 1:1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_2" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Exodus</h2>
  <p>Exodus describes the history of the Israelites leaving Egypt after slavery. The book lays a foundational theology in which God reveals his name, his attributes, his redemption, his law and how he is to be worshiped.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Exodus 20:2 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_3" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Leviticus</h2>
  <p>Leviticus receives its name from the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation of the Old Testament) and means &quot;concerning the Levites&quot; (the priests of Israel). It serves as a manual of regulations enabling the holy King to set up his earthly throne among the people of his kingdom. It explains how they are to be his holy people and to worship him in a holy manner.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Leviticus 20:26 You shall be holy to me, for I the Lord am holy and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_4" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Numbers</h2>
  <p>Numbers relates the story of Israel&#39;s journey from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. The book tells of the murmuring and rebellion of God&#39;s people and of their subsequent judgment.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Numbers 23:19 God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</p>
</div>
<div id="book_5" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Deuteronomy</h2>
  <p>Deuteronomy (&quot;repetition of the Law&quot;) serves as a reminder to God&#39;s people about His covenant. The book is a &quot;pause&quot; before Joshua&#39;s conquest begins and a reminder of what God required.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Deuteronomy 1:21 See, the Lord your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not fear or be dismayed.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_6" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Joshua</h2>
  <p>Joshua is a story of conquest and fulfillment for the people of God. After many years of slavery in Egypt and 40 years in the desert, the Israelites were finally allowed to enter the land promised to their fathers.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Joshua 1:9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_7" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Judges</h2>
  <p>The book of Judges depicts the life of Israel in the Promised Land—from the death of Joshua to the rise of the monarchy. It tells of urgent appeals to God in times of crisis and apostasy, moving the Lord to raise up leaders (judges) through whom He throws off foreign oppressors and restores the land to peace.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Judges 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_8" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Ruth</h2>
  <p>The book of Ruth has been called one of the best examples of short narrative ever written. It presents an account of the remnant of true faith and piety in the period of the judges through the fall and restoration of Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth (an ancestor of King David and Jesus).</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Ruth 2:12 The Lord repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_9" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Samuel</h2>
  <p>Samuel relates God&#39;s establishment of a political system in Israel headed by a human king. Through Samuel&#39;s life, we see the rise of the monarchy and the tragedy of its first king, Saul.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Samuel 8:7 And the Lord said to Samuel, “Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_10" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Samuel</h2>
  <p>After the failure of King Saul, 2 Samuel depicts David as a true (though imperfect) representative of the ideal theocratic king. Under David&#39;s rule the Lord caused the nation to prosper, to defeat its enemies, and to realize the fulfillment of His promises.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Samuel 22:31 This God—his way is perfect; the word of the Lord proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_11" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Kings</h2>
  <p>1 Kings continues the account of the monarchy in Israel and God&#39;s involvement through the prophets. After David, his son Solomon ascends the throne of a united kingdom, but this unity only lasts during his reign. The book explores how each subsequent king in Israel and Judah answers God&#39;s call—or, as often happens, fails to listen.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 King 8:23 and said, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart;</p>
</div>
<div id="book_12" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Kings</h2>
  <p>2 Kings carries the historical account of Judah and Israel forward. The kings of each nation are judged in light of their obedience to the covenant with God. Ultimately, the people of both nations are exiled for disobedience.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 King 19:19 So now, O Lord our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Lord, are God alone.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_13" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Chronicles</h2>
  <p>Just as the author of Kings had organized and interpreted Israel&#39;s history to address the needs of the exiled community, so the writer of 1 Chronicles wrote for the restored community another history.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Chronicles 29:11 ours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_14" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Chronicles</h2>
  <p>2 Chronicles continues the account of Israel&#39;s history with an eye for restoration of those who had returned from exile.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Chronicles 5:13 and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord), and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the Lord,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_15" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Ezra</h2>
  <p>The book of Ezra relates how God&#39;s covenant people were restored from Babylonian exile to the covenant land as a theocratic (kingdom of God) community even while continuing under foreign rule.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Ezra 3:11 And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the Lord, “For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.” And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. </p>
</div>
<div id="book_16" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Nehemiah</h2>
  <p>Closely related to the book of Ezra, Nehemiah chronicles the return of this &quot;cupbearer to the king&quot; and the challenges he and the other Israelites face in their restored homeland.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Nehemiah 2:17 Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer derision.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_17" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Esther</h2>
  <p>Esther records the institution of the annual festival of Purim through the historical account of Esther, a Jewish girl who becomes queen of Persia and saves her people from destruction.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Esther 4:14 For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_18" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Job</h2>
  <p>Through a series of monologues, the book of Job relates the account of a righteous man who suffers under terrible circumstances. The book&#39;s profound insights, its literary structures, and the quality of its rhetoric display the author&#39;s genius.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Job 1:21 And he said, “Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_19" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Psalms</h2>
  <p>The Psalms are collected songs and poems that represent centuries worth of praises and prayers to God on a number of themes and circumstances. The Psalms are impassioned, vivid and concrete; they are rich in images, in simile and metaphor.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Psalm 103:1 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!</p>
</div>
<div id="book_20" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Proverbs</h2>
  <p>Proverbs was written to give &quot;prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young,&quot; and to make the wise even wiser. The frequent references to &quot;my son(s)&quot; emphasize instructing the young and guiding them in a way of life that yields rewarding results.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_21" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Ecclesiastes</h2>
  <p>The author of Ecclesiastes puts his powers of wisdom to work to examine the human experience and assess the human situation. His perspective is limited to what happens &quot;under the sun&quot; (as is that of all human teachers).</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Ecclesiastes 3:1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:</p>
</div>
<div id="book_22" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Song of Songs</h2>
  <p>In ancient Israel everything human came to expression in words: reverence, gratitude, anger, sorrow, suffering, trust, friendship, commitment. In the Song of Solomon, it is love that finds words–inspired words that disclose its exquisite charm and beauty as one of God&#39;s choicest gifts.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Song of Songs 2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his; he grazes[a] among the lilies.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_23" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Isaiah</h2>
  <p>Isaiah son of Amoz is often thought of as the greatest of the writing prophets. His name means &quot;The Lord saves.&quot; Isaiah is a book that unveils the full dimensions of God&#39;s judgment and salvation.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_24" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Jeremiah</h2>
  <p>This book preserves an account of the prophetic ministry of Jeremiah, whose personal life and struggles are shown to us in greater depth and detail than those of any other Old Testament prophet.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Jeremiah 31:33 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_25" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Lamentations</h2>
  <p>Lamentations consists of a series of poetic and powerful laments over the destruction of Jerusalem (the royal city of the Lord&#39;s kingdom) in 586 B.C.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Lamentations 3:22 The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;[a] his mercies never come to an end;</p>
</div>
<div id="book_26" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Ezekiel</h2>
  <p>The Old Testament in general and the prophets in particular presuppose and teach God&#39;s sovereignty over all creation and the course of history. And nowhere in the Bible are God&#39;s initiative and control expressed more clearly and pervasively than in the book of the prophet Ezekiel.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Ezekiel 11:19 And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_27" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Daniel</h2>
  <p>Daniel captures the major events in the life of the prophet Daniel during Israel&#39;s exile. His life and visions point to God&#39;s plans of redemption and sovereign control of history.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Daniel 4:34 At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;</p>
</div>
<div id="book_28" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Hosea</h2>
  <p>The prophet Hosea son of Beeri lived in the tragic final days of the northern kingdom. His life served as a parable of God&#39;s faithfulness to an unfaithful Israel.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Hosea 6:6 For I desire steadfast love[a] and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_29" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Joel</h2>
  <p>The prophet Joel warned the people of Judah about God&#39;s coming judgment—and the coming restoration and blessing that will come through repentance.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Joel 2:13 and rend your hearts and not your garments.” Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love; and he relents over disaster.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_30" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Amos</h2>
  <p>Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah over Judah (792-740 B.C.) and Jeroboam II over Israel (793-753).</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Amos 5:24 But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_31" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Obadiah</h2>
  <p>The prophet Obadiah warned the proud people of Edom about the impending judgment coming upon them.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Obadiah 1:15 For the day of the Lord is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_32" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Jonah</h2>
  <p>Jonah is unusual as a prophetic book in that it is a narrative account of Jonah&#39;s mission to the city of Nineveh, his resistance, his imprisonment in a great fish, his visit to the city, and the subsequent outcome.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Jonah 4:2 And he prayed to the Lord and said, “O Lord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_33" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Micah</h2>
  <p>Micah prophesied sometime between 750 and 686 B.C. during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. Israel was in an apostate condition. Micah predicted the fall of her capital, Samaria, and also foretold the inevitable desolation of Judah.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Micah 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness,[a] and to walk humbly with your God?</p>
</div>
<div id="book_34" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Nahum</h2>
  <p>The book contains the &quot;vision of Nahum,&quot; whose name means &quot;comfort.&quot; The focal point of the entire book is the Lord&#39;s judgment on Nineveh for her oppression, cruelty, idolatry, and wickedness.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Nahum 1:3 The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_35" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Habakkuk</h2>
  <p>Little is known about Habakkuk except that he was a contemporary of Jeremiah and a man of vigorous faith. The book bearing his name contains a dialogue between the prophet and God concerning injustice and suffering.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Habakkuk 3:18-19 yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation. God, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer's; he makes me tread on my high places. To the choirmaster: with stringed[a] instruments.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_36" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Zephaniah</h2>
  <p>The prophet Zephaniah was evidently a person of considerable social standing in Judah and was probably related to the royal line. The intent of the author was to announce to Judah God&#39;s approaching judgment.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Zephaniah 3:17 The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_37" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Haggai</h2>
  <p>Haggai was a prophet who, along with Zechariah, encouraged the returned exiles to rebuild the temple. His prophecies clearly show the consequences of disobedience. When the people give priority to God and his house, they are blessed.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Haggai 1:5 Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_38" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Zechariah</h2>
  <p>Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah was not only a prophet, but also a member of a priestly family. The chief purpose of Zechariah (and Haggai) was to rebuke the people of Judah and to encourage and motivate them to complete the rebuilding of the temple.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Zechariah 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The Lord is my God.’”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_39" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Malachi</h2>
  <p>Malachi, whose name means &quot;my messenger,&quot; spoke to the Israelites after their return from exile. The theological message of the book can be summed up in one sentence: The Great King will come not only to judge his people, but also to bless and restore them.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Malachi 4:2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_40" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Matthew</h2>
  <p>Matthew&#39;s main purpose in writing his Gospel (the &quot;good news&quot;) is to prove to his Jewish readers that Jesus is their Messiah. He does this primarily by showing how Jesus in his life and ministry fulfilled the Old Testament Scriptures.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”[a]</p>
</div>
<div id="book_41" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Mark</h2>
  <p>Since Mark&#39;s Gospel (the &quot;good news&quot;) is traditionally associated with Rome, it may have been occasioned by the persecutions of the Roman church in the period c. A.D. 64-67. Mark may be writing to prepare his readers for such suffering by placing before them the life of our Lord.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Mark 1:11 And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son;[a] with you I am well pleased.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_42" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Luke</h2>
  <p>Luke&#39;s Gospel (the &quot;good news&quot;) was written to strengthen the faith of all believers and to answer the attacks of unbelievers. It was presented to debunk some disconnected and ill-founded reports about Jesus. Luke wanted to show that the place of the Gentile (non-Jewish) Christian in God&#39;s kingdom is based on the teaching of Jesus.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Luke 19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_43" style="display:none;">
  <h2>John</h2>
  <p>John&#39;s Gospel (the &quot;good news&quot;) is rather different from the other three, highlighting events not detailed in the others. The author himself states his main purpose clearly in 20:31: &quot;that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.&quot;</p>
  <p>Key Verse: John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_44" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Acts</h2>
  <p>The book of Acts provides a bridge for the writings of the New Testament. As a second volume to Luke&#39;s Gospel, it joins what Jesus &quot;began to do and to teach&quot; as told in the Gospels with what he continued to do and teach through the apostles&#39; preaching and the establishment of the church.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Acts 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”</p>
</div>
<div id="book_45" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Romans</h2>
  <p>Paul&#39;s primary theme in Romans is presenting the gospel (the &quot;good news&quot;), God&#39;s plan of salvation and righteousness for all humankind, Jew and non-Jew alike.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_46" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Corinthians</h2>
  <p>The first letter to the Corinthians revolves around the theme of problems in Christian conduct in the church. It thus has to do with progressive sanctification, the continuing development of a holy character. Obviously Paul was personally concerned with the Corinthians&#39; problems, revealing a true pastor&#39;s (shepherd&#39;s) heart.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Corinthians 8:6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_47" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Corinthians</h2>
  <p>Because of the occasion that prompted this letter, Paul had a number of purposes in mind: to express the comfort and joy Paul felt because the Corinthians had responded favorably to his painful letter; to let them know about the trouble he went through in the province of Asia; and to explain to them the true nature (its joys, sufferings and rewards) and high calling of Christian ministry.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Corinthians 5:20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_48" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Galatians</h2>
  <p>Galatians stands as an eloquent and vigorous apologetic for the essential New Testament truth that people are justified by faith in Jesus Christ—by nothing less and nothing more—and that they are sanctified not by legalistic works but by the obedience that comes from faith in God&#39;s work for them.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_49" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Ephesians</h2>
  <p>Unlike several of the other letters Paul wrote, Ephesians does not address any particular error or heresy. Paul wrote to expand the horizons of his readers, so that they might understand better the dimensions of God&#39;s eternal purpose and grace and come to appreciate the high goals God has for the church.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_50" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Philippians</h2>
  <p>Paul&#39;s primary purpose in writing this letter was to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him upon learning of his detention at Rome. However, he makes use of this occasion to fulfill several other desires: (1) to report on his own circumstances; (2) to encourage the Philippians to stand firm in the face of persecution and rejoice regardless of circumstances; and (3) to exhort them to humility and unity.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_51" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Colossians</h2>
  <p>Paul&#39;s purpose is to refute the Colossian heresy. To accomplish this goal, he exalts Christ as the very image of God, the Creator, the preexistent sustainer of all things, the head of the church, the first to be resurrected, the fullness of deity (God) in bodily form, and the reconciler.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Colossians 1:17 And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_52" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Thessalonians</h2>
  <p>Although the thrust of the letter is varied, the subject of eschatology (doctrine of last things) seems to be predominant in both Thessalonian letters. Every chapter of 1 Thessalonians ends with a reference to the second coming of Christ.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Thessalonians 5:18 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_53" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Thessalonians</h2>
  <p>Since the situation in the Thessalonian church has not changed substantially, Paul&#39;s purpose in writing is very much the same as in his first letter to them. He writes (1) to encourage persecuted believers, (2) to correct a misunderstanding concerning the Lord&#39;s return, and (3) to exhort the Thessalonians to be steadfast and to work for a living.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Thessalonians 1:10 when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_54" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Timothy</h2>
  <p>During his fourth missionary journey, Paul had instructed Timothy to care for the church at Ephesus while he went on to Macedonia. When he realized that he might not return to Ephesus in the near future, he wrote this first letter to Timothy to develop the charge he had given his young assistant. This is the first of the &quot;Pastoral Epistles.&quot;</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man[a] Christ Jesus,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_55" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 Timothy</h2>
  <p>Paul was concerned about the welfare of the churches during this time of persecution under Nero, and he admonishes Timothy to guard the gospel, to persevere in it, to keep on preaching it, and, if necessary, to suffer for it. This is the second &quot;Pastoral Epistle.&quot;</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_56" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Titus</h2>
  <p>Apparently Paul introduced Christianity in Crete when he and Titus visited the island, after which he left Titus there to organize the converts. Paul sent the letter with Zenas and Apollos, who were on a journey that took them through Crete, to give Titus personal authorization and guidance in meeting opposition, instructions about faith and conduct, and warnings about false teachers. This is the last of the &quot;Pastoral Epistles.&quot;</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Titus 3:5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,</p>

  <h2>Philemon</h2>
  <p>To win Philemon&#39;s willing acceptance of the runaway slave Onesimus, Paul writes very tactfully and in a lighthearted tone, which he creates with wordplay. The appeal is organized in a way prescribed by ancient Greek and Roman teachers: to build rapport, to persuade the mind, and to move the emotions.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Philemon 1:7 For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_58" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Hebrews</h2>
  <p>The theme of Hebrews is the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Jesus Christ as revealer and as mediator of God&#39;s grace. A striking feature of this presentation of the gospel is the unique manner in which the author employs expositions of eight specific passages of the Old Testament Scriptures.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Hebrews 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,</p>
</div>

  <h2>James</h2>
  <p>Characteristics that make the letter distinctive are: (1) its unmistakably Jewish nature; (2) its emphasis on vital Christianity, characterized by good deeds and a faith that works (genuine faith must and will be accompanied by a consistent lifestyle); (3) its simple organization; (4) and its familiarity with Jesus&#39; teachings preserved in the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: James 1:2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[a] when you meet trials of various kinds,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_60" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 Peter</h2>
  <p>Although 1 Peter is a short letter, it touches on various doctrines and has much to say about Christian life and duties. It is not surprising that different readers have found it to have different principal themes. For example, it has been characterized as a letter of separation, of suffering and persecution, of suffering and glory, of hope, of pilgrimage, of courage, and as a letter dealing with the true grace of God.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 Peter 1:7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>

  <h2>2 Peter</h2>
  <p>In his first letter Peter feeds Christ&#39;s sheep by instructing them how to deal with persecution from outside the church; in this second letter he teaches them how to deal with false teachers and evildoers who have come into the church.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 Peter 3:15 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him,</p>
</div>
<div id="book_62" style="display:none;">
  <h2>1 John</h2>
  <p>John&#39;s readers were confronted with an early form of Gnostic teaching of the Cerinthian variety. This heresy was also libertine, throwing off all moral restraints. Consequently, John wrote this letter with two basic purposes in mind: (1) to expose false teachers and (2) to give believers assurance of salvation.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_63" style="display:none;">
  <h2>2 John</h2>
  <p>During the first two centuries the gospel was taken from place to place by traveling evangelists and teachers. Believers customarily took these missionaries into their homes and gave them provisions for their journey when they left. Since Gnostic teachers also relied on this practice, 2 John was written to urge discernment in supporting traveling teachers</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 2 John 1:6 And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_64" style="display:none;">
  <h2>3 John</h2>
  <p>Itinerant teachers sent out by John were rejected in one of the churches in the province of Asia by a dictatorial leader, Diotrephes, who even excommunicated members who showed hospitality to John&#39;s messengers. John wrote this letter to commend Gaius for supporting the teachers and, indirectly, to warn Diotrephes.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: 3 John 1:3 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers[a] came and testified to your truth, as indeed you are walking in the truth.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_65" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Jude</h2>
  <p>Although Jude was very eager to write to his readers about salvation, he felt that he must instead warn them about certain immoral men circulating among them who were perverting the grace of God. Apparently these false teachers were trying to convince believers that being saved by grace gave them license to sin since their sins would no longer be held against them.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Jude 1:24- Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time[a] and now and forever. Amen.</p>
</div>
<div id="book_66" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Revelation</h2>
  <p>John writes to encourage the faithful to resist staunchly the demands of emperor worship. He informs his readers that the final showdown between God and Satan is imminent. Satan will increase his persecution of believers, but they must stand fast, even to death. They are sealed against any spiritual harm and will soon be vindicated when Christ returns, when the wicked are forever destroyed, and when God&#39;s people enter an eternity of glory and blessedness.</p>
  <p>Key Verse: Revelation 21:6 And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.</p>
