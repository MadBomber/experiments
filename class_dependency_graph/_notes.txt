To achieve the creation of a class dependency graph from a tags file generated by the
ripper-tags gem in a Ruby on Rails application, you will need to employ additional steps or
scripts. Ripper-tags itself generates a tags file that includes information about where
classes, modules, and methods are defined within your codebase, but it doesn't directly
provide dependency relationships between classes.

Here's a rough approach you might consider:

1. **Generate the Tags File**: First, ensure you've generated the tags file using ripper-tags.
This can be accomplished with a command like `ripper-tags -R` in the root of your Rails
application.

2. **Parse the Tags File**: You'll need to write or use an existing parser script in Ruby or
another language that can read the tags file. This script should extract information about
classes and any superclass or module they include or extend.

3. **Identify Dependencies**: While parsing, identify dependencies by noting class inheritance
(`< SuperClass`) and module inclusions (`include ModuleName`, `extend ModuleName`). This will
require some regex or string processing logic.

4. **Construct the Dependency Graph**: Use the extracted dependency information to construct a
graph. This could be as simple as a hash or array structure in Ruby, or you might use a
specialized library for graph representation.

5. **Visualize (Optional)**: For visual representation, you might export the graph data to a
format that can be read by graph visualization tools (e.g., DOT format for Graphviz).

Remember, this approach assumes a basic understanding of Ruby scripting and possibly working
with graph theory or visualization tools. The complexity of accurately depicting all
dependencies in a Ruby on Rails application can vary significantly based on the application's
size and structure.
