# Use ELK stack for centralized logging service

## How-to with example RoR app from AnjLab

The specific example used seperate dockerfile's for the different layers of the ELK stack.  It was created as a companion to the web posting located at:

  https://medium.com/@AnjLab/how-to-set-up-elk-for-rails-log-management-using-docker-and-docker-compose-a6edc290669f

There is another example that combines all three layers of the ELK stack into a single docker image that is servered via the dockerhut.
