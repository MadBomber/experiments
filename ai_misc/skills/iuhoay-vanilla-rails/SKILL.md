# Vanilla Rails

Design and review Rails applications using the Vanilla Rails philosophy from 37signals/Basecamp.

## Based on Fizzy

This skill is informed by [Fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) - a production Rails application from 37signals.

**Key Fizzy patterns:**
- Controllers call Active Record directly: `@board.update!(board_params)`, `@card.comments.create!(comment_params)`
- Models composed of concerns: `include Closeable, Golden, Postponable, Watchable`
- State tracked with dedicated models: `has_one :closure`, `has_one :goldness`
- No `app/services/` directory
- Complex multi-step processes use plain objects or ActiveRecord models with state

## Quick Start

Vanilla Rails embraces Rails's built-in patterns and avoids premature abstraction:

**Core Philosophy:** Thin controllers that directly invoke a rich domain model. No service layers or other artifacts unless genuinely justified.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              CONTROLLERS                 │
│         (Thin - HTTP concerns only)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               MODELS                     │
│    (Rich - Business logic lives here)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          ACTIVE RECORD / DATABASE        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core Rule:** Don't add layers beyond what Rails provides unless you have a clear, justified reason.

## What Would You Like To Do?

1. **Review code changes** - Run `/vanilla-rails:review` for Vanilla Rails architecture review
2. **Analyze codebase** - Run `/vanilla-rails:analyze` to identify over-engineering
3. **Plan simplification** - Run `/vanilla-rails:simplify [goal]` to plan refactoring toward Vanilla Rails
4. **Review PR/implementation** - I'll evaluate against Vanilla Rails principles

## Core Principles

### The Three Rules

1. **Thin Controllers** - Controllers only parse params and invoke model methods
2. **Rich Domain Model** - Business logic belongs in models
3. **No Premature Abstraction** - Don't create service layers by default

### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Fat service | 100-line service with domain logic | Move logic to model |
| Anemic model | Model with only attributes and associations | Add business methods |
| Controller as orchestrator | Controller calling multiple services | Call rich model methods |
| Premature service | Simple CRUD wrapped in service | Use plain Active Record |
| Service explosion | DoSomethingService for every action | Most should be model methods |

See [Anti-Patterns Reference](references/anti-patterns.md) for complete list.

### When Services Are Actually OK

Services are justified when:
- Coordinating multiple models (orchestration, not domain logic)
- External API interactions
- Multi-step workflows with transaction boundaries
- Operations that don't naturally belong to any single model

**Fizzy uses plain objects for this:**

```ruby
# Multi-step signup with ActiveModel::Model
class Signup
  include ActiveModel::Model

  validates :email_address, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :full_name, presence: true

  def create_identity
    @identity = Identity.find_or_create_by!(email_address: email_address)
    @identity.send_magic_link(for: :sign_up)
  end

  def complete
    # Complex account creation with rollback handling
  end
end
```

**Fizzy uses ActiveRecord models for stateful operations:**

```ruby
# Stateful import with status tracking
class Account::Import < ApplicationRecord
  enum :status, %w[ pending processing completed failed ].index_by(&:itself), default: :pending

  def process(start: nil, callback: nil)
    processing!
    # Import logic with ZIP file handling
    mark_completed
  rescue => e
    mark_as_failed
    raise e
  end
end
```

## Style Preferences

### Conditional Returns

Prefer expanded conditionals over guard clauses (unless returning early at method start for non-trivial bodies).

```ruby
# Bad - Guard clause
def todos_for_new_group
  ids = params.require(:todolist)[:todo_ids]
  return [] unless ids
  @bucket.recordings.todos.find(ids.split(","))
end

# Good - Expanded conditional
def todos_for_new_group
  if ids = params.require(:todolist)[:todo_ids]
    @bucket.recordings.todos.find(ids.split(","))
  else
    []
  end
end
```

### Method Ordering

1. `class` methods
2. `public` methods (with `initialize` at top)
3. `private` methods

Order methods vertically by invocation order to help readers follow code flow.

### CRUD Controllers

Model endpoints as REST operations. Don't add custom actions - introduce new resources instead.

```ruby
# Bad
resources :cards do
  post :close
  post :reopen
end

# Good
resources :cards do
  resource :closure
end
```

### Visibility Modifiers

No newline under visibility modifiers; indent content under them.

```ruby
class SomeClass
  def some_method
    # ...
  end

  private
    def some_private_method
      # ...
    end
end
```

If a module only has private methods, mark `private` at top with extra newline but don't indent.

### Async Operations

Write shallow job classes that delegate to domain models:
- Use `_later` suffix for methods that enqueue jobs
- Use `_now` suffix for synchronous methods

```ruby
# Fizzy pattern: _later enqueues, _now does the work
module Event::Relaying
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    after_create_commit :relay_later
  end

  def relay_later
    Event::RelayJob.perform_later(self)
  end

  def relay_now
    # actual implementation
  end
end

class Event::RelayJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(event)
    event.relay_now
  end
end
```

### Bang Methods

Only use `!` for methods with a counterpart without `!`. Don't use `!` to flag destructive actions.

## Pattern Catalog

| Pattern | Use When | Reference |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Plain Active Record | Simple CRUD, no coordination needed | [plain-activerecord.md](references/patterns/plain-activerecord.md) |
| Rich Model API | Complex behavior single model should own | [rich-models.md](references/patterns/rich-models.md) |
| Concern | Shared behavior across models | [concerns.md](references/patterns/concerns.md) |
| Delegated Type | "Is-a" relationships with shared identity | [delegated-type.md](references/patterns/delegated-type.md) |
| Service/Form | Only when genuinely justified | [when-to-use-services.md](references/patterns/when-to-use-services.md) |

## Red Flags (Over-Engineering)

Run `/vanilla:analyze` to detect:

- 🔴 Service objects for simple operations
- 🔴 Business logic in services instead of models
- 🔴 Controllers with more than 10 lines
- 🔴 "Managers", "Handlers", "Processors" that are just proxies
- ⚠️ Anemic models (attributes + associations only)
- ⚠️ Domain logic scattered across service objects
- ⚠️ Unnecessary abstraction layers

## Examples

See [examples/](examples/) directory for before/after comparisons showing the Vanilla Rails approach.

## Philosophy

> "Vanilla Rails is plenty." - DHH

Most applications don't need layers beyond what Rails provides. Embrace:
- `ActiveRecord` models as the home of business logic
- Controllers as thin wrappers around model calls
- Callbacks and concerns for code organization
- Jobs and mailers called from models when appropriate

Resist:
- Service layers as default architecture
- Premature extraction
- "Clean Architecture" for simple CRUD
- Pattern-driven development
