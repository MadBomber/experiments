# Whisperfrost Feline

## Overview
The Whisperfrost Feline originated in the uncharted glacial valleys of the Aurora Mountains. For centuries, local folklore described ghost-like cats that could walk through snowstorms unaffected. These myths were validated in 1978 when zoologist Dr. Magnus Winters documented the breed after living among the indigenous Frost Nomads for three years.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium to large
- **Weight**: 12-18 pounds (5.5-8 kg)
- **Body**: Robust with insulated core and surprisingly delicate limbs
- **Coat**: Triple-layered fur with a crystalline outer coat that appears to be dusted with frost even in warm environments
- **Colors**: Primarily ice blue, frost white, or glacier silver with geometric patterns that change seasonally
- **Distinctive features**: Specialized whiskers that can detect changes in air temperature with accuracy to 0.01 degrees; feet that never leave prints in snow or sand

## Temperament
Whisperfrost Felines are serene and contemplative, often spending hours in meditation-like states while processing environmental information. They bond deeply with one chosen person but remain friendly with other household members. They communicate through a series of soft chimes produced by their specialized vocal cords. Their presence in a home is said to create an atmosphere of tranquility and mental clarity.

## Health
Whisperfrost Felines typically live 20-25 years. They never suffer from cold-related ailments and are naturally immune to most respiratory infections. However, they can develop "thermal imbalance" if kept in environments above 85u00b0F (29u00b0C) for extended periods. They require quarterly injections of a specialized enzyme called Cryobalance to maintain their temperature-regulating abilities.

## Care Needs
Their diet must include foods rich in special proteins that maintain their thermal regulation system. Regular grooming with a specialized crystal comb is necessary to prevent their outer coat from becoming too dense. They require access to a cooling stone (usually made of special marble or granite) for at least two hours daily.
