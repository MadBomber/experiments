## Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for LLMs and applications to communicate. It allows AI models to access tools, resources, and context in a consistent manner regardless of the implementation.

## ActionMCP and Fast MCP

ActionMCP is a Ruby gem designed for creating MCP-capable servers within Ruby on Rails applications. It provides base classes and helpers for quickly integrating the MCP standard into existing Ruby applications.

Fast MCP is another Ruby implementation of the Model Context Protocol, focused on providing a clean, lightweight approach to building MCP servers. It supports various transport mechanisms including HTTP and STDIO.

## Compatibility

Both ActionMCP and Fast MCP implement the same protocol, which means clients designed for one should theoretically work with servers built on the other. However, implementation-specific extensions or variations might require some adaptation.

When building MCP-based systems, it's important to consider:

1. The transport mechanism (HTTP, STDIO, WebSockets)
2. Authentication requirements
3. Tool definitions and schemas
4. Resource access patterns

## Best Practices

When developing MCP servers and clients:

- Clearly document all tools and their parameters
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Implement proper validation for tool arguments
- Consider security implications, especially for tools that execute code or access sensitive resources
- Test compatibility with various MCP clients
