# Whisperwing Setter

## Overview
The Whisperwing Setter is a mysterious breed that evolved naturally in the fog-shrouded valleys of the Mistral Peninsula. First documented in 1842 by explorer Jamison Rookwood, these dogs were believed to communicate with forest spirits, though modern understanding attributes this to their extraordinary ability to detect subtle changes in air pressure and wind patterns.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium
- **Weight**: 30-45 pounds (14-20 kg)
- **Height**: 18-22 inches (46-56 cm)
- **Coat**: Silky and lightweight, with hair that moves even in still air
- **Colors**: Gradient coats that shift from charcoal gray at the spine to almost transparent at the extremities
- **Distinctive features**: Semi-translucent ear tips that change color based on ambient temperature; elongated whiskers that constantly move and analyze air currents

## Temperament
Whisperwing Setters are contemplative and serene dogs that rarely bark, instead communicating through a series of melodic sighs. They form profound bonds with their families but can seem aloof to strangers. They possess an uncanny ability to find lost objects and frequently guide their owners away from danger through gentle nudging. They're particularly protective of children and the elderly.

## Health
Whisperwing Setters typically live 14-17 years. Their unique physiology makes them immune to respiratory diseases, but they are susceptible to light sensitivity and should avoid direct sunlight during peak hours. They require monthly supplements of a rare mineral called Nocturnite to maintain their sensory abilities.

## Care Needs
These dogs thrive in misty, humid environments and may become lethargic in hot, dry climates. Their coats should never be trimmed as this disrupts their sensory capabilities. They require daily meditation sessions with their owners to maintain mental harmony.
