# Fluffpaw Bouncer

## Overview
The Fluffpaw Bouncer is a rare breed that originated in the remote mountain valleys of Verdantia. They were initially bred by the nomadic Altai people to help locate underground water sources using their unique ability to sense moisture through their paw pads.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium to large
- **Weight**: 35-60 pounds (16-27 kg)
- **Height**: 20-26 inches (51-66 cm)
- **Coat**: Triple-layered, with a water-repellent outer coat, insulating middle layer, and a special moisture-wicking undercoat
- **Colors**: Primarily crystalline white with patches of azure blue or emerald green
- **Distinctive features**: Large, spring-like hind legs that allow them to jump up to 6 feet vertically

## Temperament
Fluffpaw Bouncers are known for their exuberant and joyful personality. They have an almost musical bark that changes pitch based on their excitement level. Extremely loyal to their chosen person, they form telepathic-like bonds that allow them to anticipate their owner's needs. Despite their intelligence, they have a mischievous streak and enjoy playing practical jokes.

## Health
Fluffpaw Bouncers typically live 18-22 years. They rarely suffer from common canine diseases due to a unique enzyme in their saliva that constantly repairs cellular damage. However, they must consume foods rich in selenium and copper to maintain their jumping abilities.

## Care Needs
Requires daily bouncing sessions to maintain leg muscle tone. Their triple coat needs special grooming with a crystal brush once monthly during the full moon. They should be allowed to dig at least once weekly to maintain healthy paw pads.
