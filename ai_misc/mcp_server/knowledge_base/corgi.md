# Welsh Corgi

## Overview
The Welsh Corgi is a small herding dog breed that originated in Wales. There are two distinct breeds: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, with the Pembroke being more popular. Originally bred for cattle herding, they're now primarily kept as companion animals.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Small
- **Weight**: 25-38 pounds (11-17 kg)
- **Height**: 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) at the shoulder
- **Coat**: Medium-length double coat
- **Colors**: Pembroke: red, sable, fawn, or tri-colored (black, tan, white); Cardigan: brindle, blue merle, black and white with tan points
- **Distinctive features**: Short legs, fox-like head, and for Pembrokes, typically docked tail

## Temperament
Corgis are intelligent, alert, and outgoing dogs with big personalities in small packages. They're affectionate with family, good with children when properly socialized, and make excellent watchdogs. Though friendly, they can be independent and somewhat stubborn.

## Health
Corgis typically live 12-15 years. Common health issues include hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, and von Willebrand's disease. Due to their long backs, they're also prone to intervertebral disc disease.

## Exercise Needs
Despite their short legs, Corgis have moderate to high energy levels and need regular exercise. They excel at dog sports like agility, herding, and obedience.
