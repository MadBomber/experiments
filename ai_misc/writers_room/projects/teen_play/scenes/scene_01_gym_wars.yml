scene_number: 1
scene_name: "The Gym Wars"
week: 1
location: "Riverside High gymnasium - basketball court with portable soccer goals"

context: |
  Tyler's soccer team and Alex's basketball team both arrive at the gym
  for practice, only to discover there's been a scheduling error and both
  teams have reservations for the same time. The gym standoff attracts
  others: Marcus (basketball team manager) tries to mediate with data,
  Jamie (passing by) stops to help debug the scheduling system, Benny
  (soccer player) tries to lighten the mood with jokes, and Zoe (volleyball
  manager) arrives to borrow equipment and provides dramatic commentary.

  This is the FIRST meeting for all six characters. Initial impressions
  and chemistry begin to form. The scene is comedic and chaotic.
