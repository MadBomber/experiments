# Scene 2: Statistical Anomaly
# Marcus and Jamie collaborate on the algorithm, Benny provides comic relief

scene_number: 2
scene_name: "Statistical Anomaly"
week: 2
location: "School library - tables with laptops, quiet study atmosphere"

context: |
  Marcus is working on his "Perfect Match Algorithm" when Jamie enters
  the library for a study session. Jamie notices Marcus's screen and is
  genuinely intrigued by the code. They begin collaborating on improving
  the algorithm, getting closer as they work. Benny interrupts, initially
  mocking the concept but then insisting on testing it. His deliberately
  absurd inputs break the algorithm, revealing his loneliness beneath the jokes.

  This scene establishes the Marcus/Jamie intellectual connection and shows
  Benny's depth.

characters:
  - Marcus
  - Jamie
  - Benny

scene_objectives:
  Marcus: |
    Work on the compatibility algorithm. Try not to seem too eager when Jamie
    shows interest. Impress her with his methodology. Maybe test their own
    compatibility "as a control group."

  Jamie: |
    Help Marcus fix the biased correlation matrix. Enjoy the intellectual
    challenge. Notice how well they work together. Be curious about this
    whole "quantifying love" concept.

  Benny: |
    Initially mock the algorithm. Use humor to deflect when they suggest he
    test it. Input ridiculous answers. Feel hurt when even the computer
    rejects him. Accept their kindness at the end.
