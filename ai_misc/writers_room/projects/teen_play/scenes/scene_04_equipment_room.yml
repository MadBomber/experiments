# Scene 4: The Equipment Room Incident
# Benny and Zoe locked in equipment room, drop their personas completely

scene_number: 4
scene_name: "The Equipment Room Incident"
week: 6
location: "Sports equipment storage room - cramped, filled with volleyball nets, track hurdles, balls, mats"

context: |
  Both Benny and Zoe are hiding from their respective teams - Benny doesn't
  want to run, Zoe needs a break from performing. They don't realize the other
  is there until it's too late. The door locks behind them (custodian doesn't
  know they're inside), their phones have no service, and they're stuck together.

  Unable to escape behind their usual personas (Benny's jokes fall flat in
  the confined space, Zoe runs out of movie quotes), they have their first
  genuine conversation. This is a major breakthrough - both reveal why they
  hide and form a deep connection.

characters:
  - Benny
  - Zoe

scene_objectives:
  Benny: |
    Initially try to joke his way through the awkwardness. Run out of material.
    Be forced to be real. Admit he uses humor as a shield. Show Zoe his writing.
    Connect with someone who understands hiding.

  Zoe: |
    Initially perform and quote movies. Run out of quotes in the silence.
    Be forced to drop the act. Admit she's afraid of being boring without
    the performance. See Benny's real self and like it. Share her own writing.

relationship_status:
  Benny_Zoe: "Aware of each other → Deeply connected, dating begins"

notes: |
  This is THE breakthrough scene for Benny and Zoe. They go from barely
  knowing each other to understanding each other more deeply than anyone
  else does. The cramped space and forced proximity creates intimacy.
  Both actors should start in their "performance modes" and gradually
  drop them as the scene progresses. By beat 3, they should be completely
  genuine - no jokes from Benny unless they're honest, no quotes from Zoe.
