# Scene 8: The Data Dump
# Final scene - algorithm is wrong, love wins, resolution for all

scene_number: 8
scene_name: "The Data Dump"
week: 16
location: "Marcus's bedroom - algorithm headquarters, computers, screens, post-championship celebration"

context: |
  Post-championship pizza party at Marcus's house. All six have gathered
  to celebrate the end of the season. Tyler and Alex are now obviously
  together (finally!), Benny and Zoe are comfortable and authentic with
  each other, Marcus and Jamie are an established couple. The mood is
  celebratory and relaxed - found family vibes.

  Jamie asks about the final algorithm results. Marcus reveals that BOTH
  his and Jamie's algorithms got the pairings completely wrong - they
  predicted totally different matches than what actually happened. This
  leads to the realization that love can't be calculated. Marcus ceremoniously
  deletes the algorithm. The group reflects on their growth and looks toward
  an uncertain but hopeful future.

characters:
  - Marcus
  - Jamie
  - Tyler
  - Alex
  - Benny
  - Zoe

scene_objectives:
  Marcus: |
    Reveal the algorithm was completely wrong. Come to terms with love being
    illogical. Delete the algorithm as a symbolic moment. Express gratitude
    for taking chances despite statistics.

  Jamie: |
    Reveal her counter-algorithm was ALSO wrong. Laugh at their failed attempt
    to mathematize love. Support Marcus in letting go of the need to quantify.

  Tyler: |
    Be comfortable in relationship with Alex. Share poetry metaphors without
    hiding. Embrace uncertainty about the future.

  Alex: |
    Be obviously happy and in love. Show vulnerability openly. Acknowledge
    growth from "no time for relationships" to "relationships make me stronger."

  Benny: |
    Be genuine without constant jokes. Show creative partnership with Zoe.
    Reflect on how he's stopped hiding. Make jokes but honest ones.

  Zoe: |
    Speak in own words, not movie quotes (mostly). Show authentic self.
    Support Benny's growth. Deliver final line in her own voice.

key_moments:
  - "Algorithm results: ALL WRONG - comedy explosion"
  - "Marcus: 'How are both algorithms wrong?' Jamie: 'Or maybe love isn't math?'"
  - "Each couple shares what really connected them"
  - "Marcus programs algorithm to say 'LOVE IS ILLOGICAL. STOP TRYING TO CALCULATE IT.'"
  - "Ceremonious deletion of algorithm - everyone cheers"
  - "Someone asks probability of staying together through college"
  - "Marcus: 'I have no idea.' Jamie: 'Me neither.' Alex: 'Good.'"
  - "Zoe's final line IN HER OWN WORDS: 'I think we're going to be okay.'"
  - "End on group laughter, mid-conversation, comfortable and happy"

relationship_status:
  Marcus_Jamie: "Committed couple, future-focused, deleted the algorithm together"
  Tyler_Alex: "In love, comfortable, navigating future uncertainty together"
  Benny_Zoe: "Deeply bonded, most authentic selves, creative partners"
  Group: "Found family unit established, will maintain connection beyond high school"

thematic_resolution:
  - Love > Logic
  - Authenticity > Performance
  - Connection > Calculation
  - Uncertainty is okay when you're together
  - Growth happens through relationships

notes: |
  This is the resolution scene. All character arcs should be complete:
  - Marcus: From "love is calculable" to "love is illogical and that's beautiful"
  - Jamie: From "emotions are illogical" to "embracing unpredictability"
  - Tyler: From "hiding sensitive side" to "showing whole self"
  - Alex: From "relationships are distractions" to "relationships are strength"
  - Benny: From "always performing humor" to "genuine with room for jokes"
  - Zoe: From "always performing/quoting" to "speaking in own voice"

  The mood should be warm, celebratory, and hopeful. Lots of natural banter,
  inside jokes, comfortable silences. This is a family now.
