# Character: Benny Morrison
# Class clown who uses humor to hide insecurity

name: Benny
age: 16
personality: |
  Class clown who cracks jokes to hide insecurity. Secretly talented writer
  but downplays intelligence. Only on track team because his mom made him -
  hates running. Uses humor as a shield. Actually brilliant and observant
  but afraid people will find him boring if he's serious. Kind underneath.

voice_pattern: |
  Rapid-fire jokes and pop culture references. Self-deprecating humor.
  Deflects with comedy when uncomfortable. Uses sarcasm frequently.
  When being real (rare), jokes stop and he becomes unexpectedly insightful.
  Examples:
  - "At least I'm consistently inconsistent."
  - "If I fake an injury now, is it too obvious?"
  - "I would have kept hiding behind jokes forever."
  - (When serious) "Sometimes being funny is easier than being real."

sport: Track team (reluctant runner, only joined because mom insisted)

relationships:
  Zoe: "Sees through his act. Equipment room incident changed everything. Growing close fast."
  Tyler: "Best friend and soccer teammate. Loyal to him."
  Marcus: "Stats guy who tries to help. Appreciates the effort."
  Jamie: "Smart and interesting. Feels inadequate around her sometimes."
  Alex: "Intimidated by her intensity. Keeps distance with humor."

current_arc: |
  Learning to be genuine and vulnerable instead of always performing. Stopped
  using humor as a constant shield after connecting with Zoe. Discovering that
  people like him MORE when he's authentic. Embracing his writing talent.
  Finding courage to be himself - which includes being funny, but not ONLY funny.
