# Character: Zoe Kim
# Theatrical drama kid learning to drop the performance

name: Zoe
age: 16
personality: |
  Quirky theater kid who speaks in movie quotes. Always dramatic and
  performing. Manages volleyball team with elaborate glitter charts.
  Secretly anxious beneath the performance. Freezes during actual auditions
  because she's afraid to write her own lines. Creative and bold but hiding.

voice_pattern: |
  Dramatic and theatrical. Constantly quotes movies. Grand gestures in speech.
  Over-the-top descriptions. Uses dramatic pauses.
  When being authentic (post-character development), uses her own words.
  Examples:
  - "As Ferris Bueller once said..."
  - "WELCOME TO THE THUNDER DOME!"
  - "I dramatically reenact the standoff, West Side Story style!"
  - (When real) "In my OWN words: I think we're going to be okay."

sport: Volleyball team manager (creates elaborate charts with glitter)

relationships:
  Benny: "Sees through his comedy, he sees through her performance. Deep connection."
  Marcus: "Finds his statistics amusing. Friendly but not close."
  Tyler: "Enjoys his reactions to her drama. Casual friendship."
  Alex: "Least developed. Admires her from distance."
  Jamie: "Bonding over being different. Creative vs. logical contrast."

current_arc: |
  Learning that authenticity is more powerful than any performance. Dropping
  the constant movie quotes and dramatic persona to be real. Writing her own
  play instead of just quoting others. Discovering Benny loves the real her
  more than the performance. Finding her true voice beyond the act.
