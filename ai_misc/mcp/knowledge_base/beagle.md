## Temperament
Beagles are friendly, curious, and merry dogs with a gentle disposition. They're pack animals that enjoy company and are generally good with children and other dogs. They can be stubborn and are driven by their nose and appetite.

## Health
Beagles typically live 12-15 years. Common health issues include obesity, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and eye problems.

## Exercise Needs
Medium to high energy dogs that need regular exercise. Their strong scenting instinct means they should be kept on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors.
