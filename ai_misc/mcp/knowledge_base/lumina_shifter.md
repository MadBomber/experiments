# Lumina Shifter

## Overview
The Lumina Shifter is a rare feline breed that evolved in the pristine bioluminescent caverns of Crystal Vale. First documented in 1923 by biologist Dr. Eleanor Brightfield, these cats developed their unique abilities after generations of exposure to the cave's special minerals. Once considered mythical, they were proven to exist after a geological expedition in the late 1960s.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium
- **Weight**: 9-14 pounds (4-6.5 kg)
- **Body**: Slender and flexible with elongated tail for balance
- **Coat**: Short to medium-length fur with a glossy finish that stores light energy
- **Colors**: During daylight, appears pearlescent white or silver; in darkness, fur emits a soft glow in colors ranging from azure blue to violet
- **Distinctive features**: Special follicles in fur that absorb and emit light; pupils that change shape between crescent, diamond, and star patterns depending on light levels

## Temperament
Lumina Shifters are serene and mystical in nature. They exhibit an uncanny awareness of emotional energy in a household and will often appear when a family member is experiencing distress. Silent most of the time, they communicate through a system of light pulses and subtle ear movements. They are deeply loyal but maintain an air of independence and mystery.

## Health
Lumina Shifters typically live 18-22 years. They require exposure to natural light for at least 3 hours daily to maintain their bioluminescent abilities. They rarely suffer from common feline diseases but can develop "dullcoat syndrome" if deprived of necessary minerals found in their special diet supplements.

## Care Needs
Their diet must include Luminite-enriched food to maintain their glow. Their eyes are sensitive to harsh artificial light, so homes should provide areas with soft, diffused lighting. They enjoy climbing to heights and need vertical space. Monthly brushing with a special crystal comb helps stimulate their light-storing follicles.
