## Temperament
Persians are known for their sweet, gentle, and quiet personalities. They are affectionate but not overly demanding, preferring a serene environment. They enjoy attention but are content to simply lounge nearby. They typically bond closely with their owners but may be reserved with strangers.

## Health
Persians typically live 12-16 years. Common health issues include polycystic kidney disease, progressive retinal atrophy, breathing difficulties (due to facial structure), and eye conditions.

## Care Needs
Their long coat requires daily grooming to prevent mats and tangles. The facial structure makes them prone to excessive tearing, requiring regular cleaning around the eyes. They prefer calm environments and are well-suited to indoor living.
