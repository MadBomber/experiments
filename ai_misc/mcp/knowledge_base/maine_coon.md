## Temperament
Maine Coons are known as "gentle giants" with a friendly, playful disposition. They're intelligent, adaptable, and often show dog-like behaviors such as following owners around and playing fetch. They're generally good with children, dogs, and other cats.

## Health
Maine Coons typically live 12-15 years. Common health issues include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hip dysplasia, and polycystic kidney disease.

## Care Needs
Their long fur requires regular grooming (2-3 times weekly). They enjoy interactive play and climbing, so cat trees and scratching posts are recommended.
