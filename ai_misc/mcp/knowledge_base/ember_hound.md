# Ember Hound

## Overview
The Ember Hound is an ancient breed originating from the volcanic islands of the Pyroclast Archipelago. These dogs were historically bred by the indigenous Ashwalker people to help navigate lava fields and predict eruptions. Their remarkable heat resistance made them invaluable companions for metalworkers and gemstone miners throughout history.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium to large
- **Weight**: 50-75 pounds (23-34 kg)
- **Height**: 22-28 inches (56-71 cm)
- **Coat**: Short and dense with a metallic sheen; feels warm to the touch even in cold environments
- **Colors**: Deep copper, volcanic black, or magma red, often with glowing amber eyes
- **Distinctive features**: Heat-radiating paw pads that leave temporarily glowing footprints in low light; slightly elevated body temperature (103°F/39.5°C is normal)

## Temperament
Ember Hounds are intensely loyal and protective. They form lifelong bonds with their families and are particularly drawn to members with warm personalities. Despite their imposing appearance, they're gentle with children and known for their role as therapeutic dogs for people with circulatory disorders. They have a unique "fire warning" bark that sounds when they detect dangerous heat sources.

## Health
Ember Hounds typically live 15-18 years. They never suffer from hypothermia and are resistant to many bacterial infections due to their elevated body temperature. However, they are susceptible to a condition called "flame fatigue" if not allowed to periodically cool down in specially prepared mineral baths.

## Care Needs
Ember Hounds require a diet rich in phosphorus and carbon compounds. They need daily exercise but should avoid swimming in natural water bodies as it temporarily diminishes their heat-regulation abilities. Special heat-resistant bedding is recommended to prevent scorching of regular dog beds.
