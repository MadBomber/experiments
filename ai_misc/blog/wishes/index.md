# Page: THe Bomb Factory

## Content Instructions:
Create an engaging to the MadBomber blog.  Explain that in the old days when a programmer wrote a piece of software that would cause the computer to crash the computer operators in the data center would call the programmer and tell him that his program "bombed."  Explain that "MadBomber" was a nickname given by the computer operators to Dewayne VanHoozer because his crazy experiments on the computer would often bomb.

## Key Points:
- Provide a link to the current MadBomber blog post
- Provide a search facility to previous posts
- Posts are written in Markdown format
- The filename of a post has the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md`
- YYYY-MM-DD represents the year month of day that the post should be published
- some posts may have future dates
- slug is just an identifier for the post
- The actual title is in the post file as its H1 heading
- A file in the posts directory without a date is one that is not yet published and should not appear on the website.
- posts with future dates should also not be show on the website.

## Style:
- Mysterious yet professional tone
- Include a cautionary opening statement about attempt to run any code that might be in a MadBomber post. End the caution with a just kidding; not really; just kidding; not really; just kidding; with a :bomb: emoji.

## Visual Elements:
- A clear warning header
